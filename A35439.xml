            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He anſwer of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to <hi>Jobs</hi> firſt complaint, hath been opened in the fourth and fifth Chapters, together with <hi>Jobs</hi> reply, in the ſixth and ſeventh. In which he labours to diſaſperſe and vindicate himſelf from what <hi>Eliphaz</hi> had raſhly taxed him with, <hi>Hypocriſie, The name of an hypocrite (like that of a heretike) is ſuch, as no man ought to be patient under.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51057:4"/>
                  <p>But while <hi>Job</hi> endeavours to clear himſelf in the opinion, or from the imputations of one of his friends, he runnes into a further ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere of prejudices with a ſecond: Some of thoſe arguments which he had framed to pay his debt to <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> and ſave his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, being again charged upon his account, by his friend <hi>Bildad the Shuhite;</hi> who preſents himſelf (a duty very commendable) as an <hi>Advocate for God;</hi> and he conceived there was but need he ſhould. <hi>Job</hi> in his reply having (in his ſenſe) wronged the juſtice of God, he takes himſelf obliged to ſtand up and clear it, to ſhew <hi>Job</hi> his ſuppoſed ſinne, and provoke him to repentance, both by threatnings of further wrath, and promiſes of ſpeedy mercy. Thus in generall.</p>
                  <p>More diſtinctly, there are four parts of <hi>Bildads</hi> ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A confutation of <hi>Jobs</hi> reply to <hi>Eliphaz;</hi> and he gives it us ſhadowed by an elegant ſimilitude in the ſecond verſe, <hi>How long wilt thou speak theſe things? and how long ſhall the words of thy mouth be like the ſtrong winde?</hi> There's a cenſure upon all that he had ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He gives us an aſſertive Queſtion, concerning the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God; to clear it from, and ſet it above, whatſoever might ſeem to ſtain it in the eyes of men. This we have at the third verſe, <hi>Doth God pervert judgement? or doth the Almighty pervert juſtice?</hi> Not he.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In the body of the Chapter he urges divers arguments to confirm this concluſion, that, <hi>God is juſt;</hi> and there are three heads of argument, by which he confirms it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From the example of <hi>Jobs</hi> children, and from his own preſent, with the poſſibility of his future condition, in caſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, from the third verſe unto the eighth.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond argument is drawn from the teſtimony of antiquity, and that's laid down in the eighth, ninth and tenth verſes.</p>
                  <p>The third argument appears in the ſimilitudes;
<list>
                        <item>1. Of a <hi>ruſh</hi> or <hi>flag,</hi> in the 11, 12, and 13, verſes.</item>
                        <item>2. Of a <hi>spiders-web,</hi> in the 14, and 15, verſes.</item>
                        <item>3. Of a <hi>Tree flouriſhing</hi> for a time, but anon plucked up, in the 16, 17, 18, and 19, verſes. Theſe are the arguments and illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his grand aſſertion.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doth God pervert judgement? or doth the Almighty pervert ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?</hi> No he doth not. <hi>And thou maieſt learn this leſſon from thy own experience, from the example of thy children, from the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51057:4"/> teſtimony of antiquity, yea the withering ruſh, the spiders-web, the luxuriant roots and branches of a tree, may all be thy Maſters and inſtructours to teach thee this truth, That God is just.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt part of the Chapter, ſets forth the favour of God, to thoſe who are faithfull and ſincere: for having main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the juſtice of God, and ſhewed how terrible he will be to hypocrites who deal falſly with him; he now mitigates and molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his diſcourſe, by proclaiming the goodneſſe of God to ſinners repenting, yea (who are the worſt of ſinners) to hypocrites if they repent, pluck off their masks or diſguiſes, and truly humble themſelves before him. This is the ſubject of the three laſt verſes of the Chapter, <hi>Behold God will not caſt away a perfect man.</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, <hi>Though God be juſt to deal with hypocrites, as he hath dealt with thee and thy children, yet he will not caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the perfect and upright; ſhew thy ſelf ſuch, and he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee.</hi> This he quickens by ſubjoyning the further ſeverity of God to thoſe that ſhall perſiſt in their hypocriſie, ver. 20. and in the cloſe of the 22. <hi>Neither will he help the evil doers, and the dwelling place of the wicked ſhall come to nought.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you have both the generall ſcope, and likewiſe the ſpeciall parts of <hi>Bildads</hi> diſcourſe, which will give us ſome help towards a more clear diſcovery of particulars.</p>

When the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> (1 Pet. 4.3.) ſaith, <hi>The time paſt of our life may ſuffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles;</hi> his meaning is, <hi>the time paſt is too much:</hi> our luſts have got too much of our lives, as the world hath got too much of our loves. One minute is more then we owe to the ſervice of ſinne. The ſufficiency here ſpoken of is an exceſſe; the time paſt of our lives is too much to work the will of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> We may not make an equall diviſion of our lives between our luſts and Chriſt, ſo much to Chriſt, ſo much to luſt. Nothing is more unequall then this equality. We can never ſerve Chriſt too long, nor ſinne too ſhort a time. We cannot beſtow too much of our breath in holy ſpeeches and conferences; nor can we beſtow too little in thoſe which are vain and ſinfull. We may juſtly take off thoſe who are moſt conciſe and laconicall in uſeleſſe diſcourſes, with, <hi>How long will you ſpeak theſe things? Frothie words are the waſte of time as well as of breath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Note, <hi>Bildad</hi> rebukes <hi>Job</hi> for his laviſh language.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is our dutie to be watchfull over our words.</hi> How long wilt thou ſpeak thus? We muſt obſerve our own words, and know what we ſpeak.

                     <p>Fourthly, Taking <hi>Bildad</hi> as miſtaken (and ſo he was) in this reproof and cenſure upon <hi>Job.</hi> Obſerve</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reproofs and often grounded upon miſtakes.</hi> It is eaſie to reprove, what we doe not apprehend. <hi>Bildad</hi> perceived not the reach and drift of <hi>Job,</hi> and yet he fals heavily upon him with reproofs. A due underſtanding of his ſcope, would have given a fair comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his words. But <hi>Bildad</hi> clothes the ſpeech of <hi>Job,</hi> in a ſenſe which he abhorred; and having put it in that ugly dreſſe, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves and cenſures it accordingly. Many disfigure the opinions and doctrines of others with conceits of their own, and preſuming they hold or mean thus and thus, they diſpute not againſt the reall opinion of the oppoſite party, but their own diſguiſe. As the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> were often put into Lions, or Bears-skins, by their barbarous and heatheniſh perſecutours, and then baited with doggs; ſo are the opinions of many <hi>later Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> debated.</p>

                        <hi>Bildad</hi> is conceived to allude to a certain ſort or ſect of men. For from <hi>Cabir</hi> here tranſlated <hi>ſtrong,</hi> the name of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Poets or old Prophets is derived, whom the Greeks and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines called <hi>Cabirs</hi> or <hi>Cabirims.</hi> Theſe men had an affected out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gravity, yet were full of words, and much given to <hi>Battolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> repeating the ſame things over and over. <hi>Bildad</hi> ranks <hi>Job</hi> (ſay ſome) with thoſe Prophets, <hi>How long ſhall the words of thy mouth be like thoſe roming Cabirs,</hi> who by a needleſſe multiplying of words, grated the eares, and burdened the ſpirits of all the hearers? Why doeſt thou ſpeak, as if thou couldſt carry the matter with empty words, and bare repetitions.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The word <hi>ſtrong winde,</hi> may note the ſtoutneſſe of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit, or the magnanimity he expreſt in his words. <hi>Jobs</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was not cold and chill, as if his breath were frozen, but he ſpake with hight and heat, <hi>The spirit and courage of a man, breaths out at his lips; How long ſhall the words of thy mouth be a ſtrong winde?</hi> When wilt thou yeeld to God, and lie humbly at his feet? What a heart haſt thou?

                     <p>Fourthly, Take in the ſimilitude, <hi>How long ſhall the words of thy mouth be as a ſtrong winde?</hi> That is, how long wilt thou ſpeak ſo much, and ſpeak ſo fiercely.

                     <p>Such words are like a ſtrong winde.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe of their bluſtering noiſe. There are ſtormy and tempeſtuous words. <hi>The tempeſt of the tongue is one of the greateſt tempests in the world.</hi> Paſſionate language troubles both the air and ear, makes all unquiet, like an enraged angry winde.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, In ſuch words as in ſtormy windes there is great ſtrength to bear all down before them, or to ſway all to that point they blow for. As all the trees in a forreſt look that way which the winde ſits: ſo all the ſpirits in any Aſſembly, are apt to turn that way which words bearing a fair ſhew of reaſon direct. How often are the judgements and opinions of men, carried by words either to good or evil, to truth or errour. And unleſſe a man have good abilities of judgement and reaſon, to manage what he knows or holds, and to make himſelf maſter of it: It is a hard thing upon a large winde of anothers diſcourſe, not to have his opinion turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Hence the Apoſtle (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1.11.) ſpeaking of <hi>vain-talkers,</hi> ſaith, Their words <hi>ſubvert whole houſes;</hi> as a ſtrong winde, ſo ſtrong words blow houſes down, <hi>They ſubvert whole houſes;</hi> as that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the frame and materials of the houſe, ſo this the people or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the houſe; when Chriſt breathed graciouſly towards <hi>Zacheus,</hi> he ſaid (<hi>Luk.</hi> 19.9.) <hi>This day is ſalvation come to this houſe;</hi> when falſe teachers breathe erroniouſly, <hi>ſubverſion comes to many houſes.</hi> The Apoſtle (<hi>Epheſ</hi> 4.14.) uſing this ſimilitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the doctrines of men, adviſeth us to look to our ground, and that we be well rooted; <hi>That we be no more children, toſſed too and fro, and carried with every winde of doctrine;</hi> as if he had ſaid, The winde that blows from the lips of ſeducers (unleſſe you be well eſtabliſhed) will carry you to and fro like children, or wave your tops up and down as trees, yea endanger the pulling you up by the roots.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Strong words are as ſtrong windes in a good ſenſe, for as many ſtrong windes purge and cleanſe the air, making it more pure and healthy, ſo thoſe ſtrong wholeſome windes from the mouths of men, purge the minde of errour and cleanſe the ſoul of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51057:7"/> ſinne: This is the ſpeciall means which Chriſt hath ſet up to cleanſe his people from infectious and noiſome opinions. Theſe he diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and diſpels by the breath of his Miniſters, in the faithfull and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative diſpenſation of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, There are ill qualities in ſtrong windes; ſome are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious windes, they corrupt the ayr, conveying ill vapours to the places on which they breathe: So there is a ſtrong, unwholſome winde of words, which carries unto ſin or errour. How often are the ſpirits and manners of men infected and poiſon'd by ſuch a breath?</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, They may be compared unto ſtrong windes, in regard of the lightneſſe of them; the winde hath little ſolidity in it, and that's it, which <hi>Bildad</hi> eſpecially reproveth in <hi>Job;</hi> here are a great many words, much of the tongue, but here's little matter, <hi>Words without weight are but winde:</hi> when you gather them up, weigh and conſider them fully, you can make nothing of them, ther's no tack in them. Winde will not feed, no more will ſuch words; but wholeſome and faithfull words are meat and drinke, ſtrength and nouriſhment to the ſoul: Sound diſcourſe yeelds a well tempered underſtanding, many refreſhing morſels.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, They are like ſtrong windes for the ſwiftneſſe of them; words paſſe ſpeedily, and fill all quickly; <hi>Their line is gone out tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all the earth, and their words to the end of the world,</hi> Pſal. 19.4. Another Pſalm ſpeaks as much of wicked men, <hi>Their tongue walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thorow the earth,</hi> Pſal. 73.9. as the winde runs from one part of the world to another: So doe words, when they are ſent upon an errand, either to doe good, or to doe hurt; Therefore God choſe the Miniſtery of the Word, as an inſtrument to ſave his people. And it is the fitteſt inſtrument, running ſwiftly into the ears, and ſo conducting truth into the hearts of thouſands at once. Upon the day of Pentecoſt (<hi>Act.</hi> 2.2, 3.) when the Diſciples met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the text ſaith, <hi>Suddenly there came a ſound from heaven as of a ruſhing mighty winde, and it filled all the houſe where they were ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;</hi> firſt comes a ruſhing winde; what followeth? <hi>There appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them cloven tongues with fire.</hi> Theſe repreſented the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how the Goſpel ſhould be conveyed thorow the world: The holy Ghoſt is ſent in tongues, to ſhew that by tongues tipt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, acted and moved by the holy Ghoſt, the world ſhould be ſubdued to the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt. The tongue is the chief Organ of ſpeech. And obſerve, with the tongues there comes a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51057:8"/> wind, a ruſhing wind, implying that words ſpoken by thoſe tongues ſhould be as a mighty ruſhing winde, and like that winde, which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the houſe where they ſate, ſhould fill the world, even all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the ſound of the Goſpel; that, like a ſtrong winde they ſhould bear down the errours, ſins and luſts of men before them, and like a wholſome winde, purge and winnow out all the filthines and uncleanneſſe, the chaff and duſt of mens ſpirits. By cloven tongues and a ruſhing winde, wonders have been wrought in the world. <hi>As thoſe unruly talkers</hi> (Tit. 1.11.) <hi>ſubverted, ſo thoſe who talk by rule, have converted whole houſes;</hi> The winde of words blows both good and evil to the world; and we may as much encourage holy tongues, <hi>Let your words he long and long, a ſtrong winde:</hi> as check a vain talker in the language of <hi>Bildad, How long ſhall thy words be a ſtrong winde.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From this generall reproof, <hi>Bildad</hi> deſcends to a ſpeciall charge againſt <hi>Job.</hi>

                     <p>As if he had ſaid, <hi>Job, thou haſt spoken words which like a ſtrong winde pervert all things, and turn them up-ſide-down.</hi> But, <hi>Doth God pervert?

                     <p n="1">1. It notes God all-ſufficient to doe what he pleaſeth, or to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect what he deſigneth: if he gives direction for any judgement to be executed, he is <hi>Shaddai,</hi> It ſhall be done. As he is <hi>El,</hi> a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Judge to give ſentence, ſo he is <hi>Shaddai,</hi> an Almighty God to execute the ſentence: There is no reſiſting his power, no getting out of his hands, his name is <hi>Shaddai.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The word ſignifies, <hi>one who hath all abundance, plenty and fulneſſe in himſelf;</hi> As alſo, whoſe power, goodneſſe and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, flow out to the ſupply of others, himſelf having no need to receive from any other. He is a <hi>fountain of all for all.</hi> Hence <hi>Shaddai</hi> cannot but doe juſtice; He that hath abundance in himſelf needs not take bribes to pervert juſtice, <hi>Needy Judges are often co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Judges: they who have not a fulneſſe of their own, are under a great temptation to wrong others, to ſupply their wants.</hi> But he that gives to all, needs not receive from any. This conſideration ſets God infinitely above one of the ſtrongeſt temptations to injuſtice.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The word <hi>Shaddai,</hi> is rendered, <hi>The maker of all things.</hi> Will the Almighty, the maker of all things, who hath ſet the world in ſuch an exquiſite forme and order, who hath given ſo much beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the creature; will he put things out of order, or doe ſuch a deformed act as this, <hi>pervert justice?</hi> He that is the maker of all things, and hath made them in number, weight and meaſure, will he turn the world up-ſide-down, or make confuſion in the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not poſſible he ſhould.</p>
                     <p>So then the name <hi>Shaddai,</hi> in theſe three ſenſes, is aptly applied to God, in oppoſition to the perverting of juſtice. As <hi>Abraham</hi> debates the matter with him (<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25.) <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the earth doe right?</hi> It is impoſſible for God who judgeth all men, to doe an act of injuſtice unto any man. He that judgeth all can doe injuſtice to none. God takes no advantage to be unjuſt, becauſe none can call him to account for injuſtice. They ſhould be furtheſt from doing wrong, who need not fear any appeal from them, or complaint againſt them, if they doe wrong. The Judge of the whole earth hath none to judge him. He will do right to all, who cannot be judged by any.</p>
                     <p>Further, Conſider thoſe two words, <hi>judgement and juſtice.</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51057:9"/> Judgement and juſtice are often put in Scripture for the ſame, and when put together, the later is as an epithite to the former, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.121. <hi>I have done judgement and juſtice:</hi> that is, I have done judgement <hi>juſtly,</hi> exactly, to a hair. Sometimes they have a diſtinct ſignification.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Facere legem &amp; praeceptum eſt facere judicium. Deus ideo leges ſuas judicia vocat, quod aequiſſima ſunt, quae praeſcribit.</note>Firſt, Judgement ſignifies, that right which every man ought to doe at all times (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.7.)</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Law or rule it ſelf according to which every man is to do right, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.10. God cals all his Laws <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> becauſe they are all, moſt juſt and equall. Judgement hath a three-fold oppoſition, by which we may underſtand the nature of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Judgement is oppoſed to anger, rigour and ſeverity, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Correct me, O Lord, but with judgement, not in thine angere</hi> That is, Correct me mercifully, moderately, and in meaſure: ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not thy whole diſpleaſure to ariſe;<note place="margin">Ezek. 44.14.</note> doe not exact the utmoſt farthing. In which ſenſe the judgements of God upon wicked men in hell, ſhall be without judgement: And thus to doe a thing without judgement, is all one, as to do it without mercy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Judgement is oppoſed to folly, or to fooliſhneſſe: Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is wiſdome; when we ſay, Such an one is <hi>a man of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> we mean, he is a wiſe man. Thus judgement is an ability to judge.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Judgement oppoſed to injuſtice and wrong, which is the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and common meaning.</p>
                     <p>We may take it in any of theſe ſenſes here. As judgement is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to anger, ſo it is moderation in juſtice, <hi>Will the Lord pervert judgement?</hi> That is, will not he be as moderate in execut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ng judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as equity can admit? <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.9. <hi>I will not execute the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mine anger. I will not return to deſtroy Ephraim, for I am God and not man, the Holy One in the midſt of thee, and I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the City.</hi> As an enemy having taken a City, to ſhew them ſome favour, ſaith, I will not enter your City with my Army, to ſpoyl and plunder you: ſo God ſpeaks here, <hi>Though men be as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as they can, yet God will not be as angry as he can.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, Will he pervert judgement, as it imports wiſdome? No, he walks exactly by the rule of wiſdome, of the higheſt and pureſt wiſdome. There are no miſts or clouds of ignorance before the eye of his underſtanding. And as he hath no darkneſſe, ſo no falſe lights.</p>

                        <hi>Will the Lord pervert judgement?</hi> Will he wrong any man? Carries he a matter ſiniſterly or partially? He will not do it.</p>
                     <p>Againe, As judgement and juſtice are taken preciſely or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Judgement ſignifies due order in trying and finding out the ſtate of a cauſe: And juſtice the giving of ſentence upon that triall.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Judgement is a clear knowledge of what ought to be done: And juſtice is the doing of that which we know. Juſtice is an evenneſſe and uprightneſſe of conſcience, in paſſing every thing according to received light.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Some diſtinguiſh them thus: Judgement is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning thoſe that are guilty, and juſtice is in abſolving and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitting thoſe that are innocent, or rewarding thoſe who have done well.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Thus: Judgement reſpects capitall cauſes which are for life; and juſtice reſpects civill cauſes, which are for eſtate or liberty.</p>
                     <p>Take them in any of theſe ſenſes, or under whatſoever other diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they are conſiderable. The Lord God <hi>El-Shaddai,</hi> is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter of either. He never diſturbs or cloggs the order of tryall; He is no hinderer of the ſentence from due execution. He exactly underſtands every cauſe, and he awards what is due to every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He wrongs no man in life or limb, in eſtate or liberty.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee what judgement and juſtice are: I ſhall now open what it is to pervert judgement and juſtice. The ſame word is uſed in both.<note n="*" place="margin">Iſtae re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitiones div na eloquia multum comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        <hi>Doth God pervert?]</hi> Some tranſlate it, ſupplant juſtice. And ſo it imports, ſecret, cunning waies of injuſtice; for to ſupplant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is to come behinde a man, and to ſtrike up his heels, and caſt him down, or to lay ſomewhat in his way, upon which he may trip or ſtumble, and then fall. God doth not ſupplant juſtice, he layes no plots, he ſets no ſnares to entangle or overthrow a man in his cauſe.</p>
                     <p>More largely, The word ſignifieth, <hi>To make crooked,</hi> and ſo it very well anſwers the point in hand. Judgement and juſtice are both carried by a ſtraight line: They are the rectitude of our actions. To pervert judgement, is to make crooked lines: So we have the word (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.16.) <hi>That which is crooked cannot be made ſtraight.</hi>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:51057:10"/> He means it of civill, not naturall things, whoſe crookedneſſe is often cured by art; but who can cure all civill evils; man is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by all his diligence to turn the courſe of things which God hath determined, though to him there appear much crookedneſſe, and many diſtortions. <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf makes this interpretation (Chap. 7.13.) where he ſhews, that it is beſt to ſubmit to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his will is irreſiſtible, and the effects of it unavoidable, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the work of God, for who can make that ſtraight which he hath made crooked?</hi> So then, to pervert judgement is to make judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment crooked; or to make judgement (to which all things and perſons ſhould bow) to bow it ſelf down, as the word is alſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.3. In the deſcription of old-age, <hi>The ſtrong men ſhall bow themſelves;</hi> the leggs and knees in old-age bow and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under us. <hi>To pervert juſtice is to creeple justice, to make it lame and halt.</hi> This word is tranſlated <hi>to overthrow (Job</hi> 19.6.) <hi>Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compast me in with his net. Iob</hi> ſpeaks in a great paſſion, as if God had come upon him violently in judgement, and caſt him: We ſay a man is overthrown or caſt in his ſute. God overthrows men and Nations; but he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver overthrows juſtice. A man who overthrowes his adverſary, may ſettle juſtice. <hi>Iob</hi> looked upon himſelf, as one againſt whom God had entred his action, and overthrown him in the ſute. Lamenting <hi>Ieremy</hi> cries out (<hi>Lam.</hi> 3.59.) <hi>O Lord, thou haſt ſeen my wrong</hi> (it is this word) Thou haſt ſeen how I am vexed, and wreſted by the hard dealings of men, <hi>judge thou my cauſe;</hi> Thou wilt judge me aright, and ſet me ſtraight again.</p>
                     <p>Judgement is perverted two waies,
<list>
                           <item>1. By ſubtilty.</item>
                           <item>2. By power.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, Some pervert judgement by ſubtilty; They are wiſe to do evil. The Lord hath infinite wiſdome, and ſo is able to go beyond and over-reach all creatures; he is wiſe enough to be-fool all the world: but he is not wiſe to doe evil; His wiſedome is not a trap or a ſnare to others, but an unerring guide and light to himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Some pervert judgement by violence and force: if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not untie the knot by craft, they will cut it aſunder by power; and if they have not law for it, they have will for it, and an arm for it, and it ſhall be done. The Lord can doe what he will, but he hath no will to doe what is evil. He can put forth as much
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51057:10"/> ſtrength as he deſires, but he hath no deſire to pervert juſtice, or to act his power to over-aw and maſter it.</p>
                     <p>Further, To pervert judgement and juſtice, hath theſe two things in it.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>To darken and obſcure the rule of judgement.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>To torture or miſ-interpret the rule of judgement.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p n="1">1. Judgement is perverted by darkning and obſcuring the law or rule of juſtice. God doth not doe ſo. He never caſts a miſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Word, or a vail over it, that he may act againſt it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Neither doth he miſ-interpret his law. A good law ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded is made the warrant of an evil judgement. A gloſſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the text of the Law corrupts juſtice. <hi>Where tongue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are ſet to ſale, the wit muſt finde out ſomewhat to help the market.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The words opened invite theſe Obſervations. Firſt, That</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God is moſt exact in judgement, God is a juſt God.</hi> It is a high truth, and we ſhould adore it, that whatſoever God doth, he is juſt in doing it. When reaſon cannot reach, or make it out, yet faith muſt; and we muſt honour God in what we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: The Lord is righteous in all his waies, though his waies are paſt finding out. For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He hears every cauſe before he judges. He doth not judge one ſide, before he knows the other, or judge any man before he hath heard him fully out: We ſee both (<hi>Gen.</hi> 11. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.) in thoſe two great acts of juſtice, when God confounded the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Babel,</hi> and when he deſtroyed <hi>Sodome, I will goe down and ſee whether it be altogether according to the report that is come up unto me.</hi> God needs no intelligence to be brought him unto heaven: neither doth he that fils all places goe to any place to enform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: but he ſpeaks thus, to note how exact he is in point of juſtice; To ſhew, that he deals with the children of men, as a man: who, hearing a report of ſuch a thing done, ſaith, I will not judge of it by what I hear, but I will goe ſee whether it be ſo or no. Without evidence of the fact, the ſentence cannot be juſt, though it may be right.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He examineth and takes confeſſion, which is another point of juſtice. So he proceeded with our firſt parents (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.) propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing interrogatories unto them, and then the judgement is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced according unto what was confeſt; he judgeth them out of their own mouths, ver. 17. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt done this, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51057:11"/> hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. God proceeds by the evidence of the Law, as well as by the evidence of the fact; and this alſo ſets forth the exactneſſe of his judgement: Theſe two things make judgement perfect; you muſt not only have the evidence of the fact, that ſuch a thing is done, but you muſt have the evidence of the Law condemning ſuch a deed. Though God himſelf be an everlaſting Law, and he may judge all from his own breaſt; yet he hath given out a Law, which gives the knowledge of ſinne. It is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>They that have ſinned without the Law, ſhall periſh without the Law,</hi> as if ſome ſhould be judged without Law: but he means without a Law formally publiſhed, not materially enacted. For he ſpeaks of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who were not within the hearing of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and had not ſeen that formality of a <hi>Law written in tables of ſtone;</hi> yet they had a <hi>Law written in their hearts;</hi> They that have not heard the Law publiſhed or ſeen it written in a book, ſhall be judged by the Law <hi>written in their hearts, their conſcience bearing them witneſſe, and their thoughts accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. God is impartiall in giving judgement. He doth not ſtrike one and ſpare another, who is under the ſame condemnation; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſway or bias him, nothing can preponderate the balance of juſtice in his hand; you cannot put in any conſideration to ſway his beam, beſide the right.</p>
                     <p>There are three things which uſually cauſe men to pervert juſtice, The Lord is free from them all.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Fear of greatneſſe.</hi> Some would doe juſtice, but they dare not, the buſineſſe concerns a great man, and to doe juſtice upon ſuch, is, <hi>To take a Bear by the tooth</hi> (as we ſay) <hi>or to play with the paw of a Lion.</hi> Now the Lord is not turned away for fear, nor deferrs he juſtice for any mans big looks, <hi>The day of the Lord</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.) <hi>ſhall be againſt the high Oaks.</hi> He is <hi>El-Shaddai,</hi> the All-mighty, the all-powerfull God, and therefore cares not for the might or power of man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Hope of reward,</hi> that's another thing which cauſeth many to pervert judgement. With ſome their hope is ſtronger then their fear: They care not for the greatneſſe of men, but they hope for gain. A bribe taken or promiſed clogs and obſtructs the courſe of juſtice (Hoſ. 4.14.) <hi>Her Rulers with ſhame doe love, Give ye;</hi> the Hebrew is, <hi>Her ſhields,</hi> Magiſtrates ſhould be as ſhields to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to protect them, but what did they? <hi>They love, Give ye,</hi> that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51057:11"/> word pleaſed them. They were more pleaſed with receiving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, then with doing right. The Lord is above all gifts, he is <hi>Shaddai,</hi> he hath all in himſelf, and needs not that any ſhould give unto him; and he tels them expreſſely (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.19.) <hi>That their ſilver and their gold ſhall not be able to deliver them in the day of his wrath;</hi> offer thouſands of ſilver and gold, he will not ſtay judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a minute for it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Riches profit not in the day of wrath;</hi> In the day of mans wrath they ſometimes will, but never in the day of Gods.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Affection and neerneſſe of relation pervert judgement.</hi> Many have clean hands, free from bribes, and ſtout hearts free from fears, yet they are overcome with affection and relations; theſe put out the eye of juſtice. The Lord is above all relations. As he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us in our cleaving unto Chriſt, not to know father or mother, <hi>Yea to hate Father and mother, wife,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Etiamſi fuiſſet Ieconia mihi chariſſimus, que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſemper in oculis ſerrem. <hi>Jun.</hi>
                        </note> &amp;c. (and thoſe are neereſt to us) that we may keep cloſe unto Chriſt: So himſelf doth not know the neereſt relation, to pervert judgement or doe wrong in favour of it. Hence he ſaith of <hi>Coniah</hi> (Jer. 22.24.) <hi>Though Coniah be as the ſignet upon my right hand, yet will I pluck him thence;</hi> Let him plead neerneſſe (as men doe, ſuch a man is of your bloud or alliance, pray ſpare him) God will not ſpare the ſignet on his right hand, that is, he will not ſtop juſtice upon any pretence of neerneſſe or uſefulneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. God is exact (take them dictinctly) both in judgement and in juſtice. He is as curious in ſearching out the cauſe, as in ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the perſon. As ready to acquit the innocent, as to condemn the guilty: as carefull to relieve the oppreſſed, as to chaſten the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſour: as<note n="*" place="margin">Pervertii jus, qui non punit improbos, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertit juſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, qui non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerat ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorum bona opera. <hi>Druſ.</hi>
                        </note> zealous in rewarding thoſe who deſerve well, as in puniſhing thoſe who doe evil. Not to reward is as great injuſtice, as not to puniſh. What God hath promiſed ſhall be performed, and what he threatens ſhall be inflicted. He will neither diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage goodneſſe by neglecting it, nor encourage ſinne by winking at it. He hath bread in one hand, and a ſword in the other.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee, The Lord is moſt exact in juſtice (Pſal. 48.10.) <hi>The right hand of the Lord is full of righteouſneſſe.</hi> His power and might are his right hand; and that right hand hath nothing but righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in it. Few men come to that of <hi>Laban, It is in the power of mine hand to doe thee hurt,</hi> but I will not: moſt doe as much hurt as is in their power. God hath all power in his hand, but he wrongs no man. As none have now any cauſe to ſay, that they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51057:12"/> wrong from the hand of God: ſo at laſt all ſhall confeſſe they have not.</p>
                     <p>Further, <hi>Bildad</hi> ſpeaking upon ſuppoſition, that God was wronged injuſtice, teacheth us, That</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is a duty to vindicate the juſtice of God, whenſoever we hear i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> wronged.</hi> When we hear any wounding God is his faithfulneſſe, truth, or juſtice, we ſhould preſently ſtand up to plead for him; What, will God be unfaithfull? Will God pervert judgement? Will God be untrue? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus we ſhould plead for God. When <hi>Jeremy</hi> could not make out the juſtice of God, he is an advocate for his juſtice, <hi>Lord, thou art righteous, yet let me plead with thee.</hi> He would not have the matter once queſtioned, though the manner was enquired.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Obſerve, That</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The judgements of God may be ſecrets to us, but they are never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries to us.</hi> Juſtice is in all the dealings of God, but his juſtice is not alwaies viſible. His judgements are founded upon reaſon, when upon his will, for his will is the higheſt reaſon. God cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and he ever puniſhes thoſe who are. He is ſo farre from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting judgement, that he ſubverteth Kings and Magiſtrates, yea Nations and Kingdoms for ſubverting judgement; <hi>To ſubvert a man in his cauſe, the Lord approveth not,</hi> Lam. 3.36. The Hebrew is, <hi>The Lord ſeeth not:</hi> That is, he doth not ſee it to approve it; but he doth ſee it to puniſh it. He is an avenger of thoſe who will not avenge the oppreſſed. And as he looks for judgement in all places, ſo eſpecially among his own people, upon whom he beſtows moſt mercy. (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.2.) When the Lord done ſo much for his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, <hi>He looked for judgements, and behold oppreſſion; for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but behold a cry.</hi> God makes privy ſearch thorow a Nation to finde this jewell: Judgement between man and man in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, which is, <hi>commutative juſtice;</hi> judgement from Magiſtrates to the people, which is <hi>diſtributive juſtice:</hi> for theſe God is ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at this day; one of the greateſt ſins among us, is, the perverting of judgement: And untill judgement return to man, how can we expect mercy ſhould return from God? (Jer. 5.1.) <hi>Runne to and fro thorow the ſtreets of Jeruſalem, and ſeek in the broad places thereof, if you can finde a man, if there be any that executeth judgement, that loves the truth, and I will pardon it.</hi> A Land is ſeldom fill'd with the judgements of God, till it is emptied of judgement among men. What a ſad thing is it that there ſhould be ſo many cries againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51057:12"/> on earth, in a time when there is ſo much crying out for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from heaven! That in ſuch a time when the judgements of God are upon our ſelves, we ſhould not learn righteouſneſſe to act it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelves! I am perſwaded the <hi>Sword of warre</hi> had been ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in it's ſheath to this day, if the <hi>Sword of juſtice</hi> had been uſed as it ought, both to puniſh offenders, and protect the innocent. And when the ſword of juſtice ſhall be both waies imployed, I doubt not but the ſword of warre ſhall be ſheathed again, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed no more, but be <hi>beaten into plow-ſhares, and our spears into pruning hoks. Keep ye judgement</hi> (ſaith the Lord by his Prophet, <hi>Iſa</hi> 56.1) <hi>for my ſalvation is neer to come, and my righteouſneſſe to be revealed.</hi> God hath done terrible things in righteouſneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and we hope he will doe comfortable things in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe among us: ſeeing the righteous deſtructions of God have been upon us, and his righteous ſalvations (we hope) are neer us, let not our righteouſneſſe be farre off.</p>

Then, <hi>God is juſt,</hi> there's the Poſition. And as that Poſition conſiſteth of two parts, ſo alſo doth this proof or confirmation of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God doth not pervert judgement (taking judgement under that ſtrict notion for puniſhing of offenders) he proveth by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51057:13"/> the example of <hi>Jobs</hi> children, whom God puniſhed becauſe of their tranſgreſſion, as he conceived.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>His argument for the former may be thus conceived.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>He doth not pervert judgement who puniſheth thoſe who have ſinned againſt him.</p>

                     <p>Therefore he doth not pervert judgement.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>His argument for the later may be thus formed.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>He doth not pervert justice who is ready to pity aſſoon as an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender humbly ſeeks, ſues and ſubmits unto him.</p>

                  <p>Thus you have the generall ſenſe of theſe four verſes, as argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments brought for proof of the former point, that God doth not pervert judgement or juſtice. I ſhall now open them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly.</p>

A childe left, or ſent to himſelf, is one that hath no guide, no governour, no inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour but himſelf. <hi>A man that will learn only of himſelf, hath but a fool to his Maſter,</hi> How much more then a weak childe, what a maſter, what a tutour hath a childe, if he have none but himſelf. To be <hi>left or ſent out to themſelves</hi> is, to have none to counſell or adviſe them in a right way, or to give them any ſtop and check in an ill way. The character that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> gave of the former times, when they preached to the Heathens at <hi>Lystra,</hi> was this (<hi>Act.</hi> 14.16.) <hi>We exhort you to turn unto the living God that made heaven and earth, who in times paſt ſuffered all Nations to walk in their own waies.</hi> He let them goe, and never ſtaied them at all, they had no bridle of reſtraint, not ſo much as a word to bring them back; <hi>He ſuffered all Nations,</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>He left them in the hand of their tranſgreſſion,</hi> that their own evil hearts ſhould doe what they would with them.

But there is another ſenſe, which I rather embrace, <hi>The times of that ignorance God winked at;</hi> that is, in thoſe times wherein there was ſo much darkneſſe and blindeneſſe in the world, God let men goe on in their ſinne; they ſinned, and he never called upon them, he never oppoſed them, or ſent any to teach them better. God did not manifeſt his will to them as unto the Jews, Pſal. 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51057:15"/> Jacob, his ſtatutes and judgements unto Iſrael; he hath not dealt ſo with any Nation,</hi> &amp;c. So that this winking is oppoſed to favour, rather then to juſtice. To have the eye upon a place, or upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is to ſhew them favour, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.29. The later branch clears this meaning, <hi>But now he calleth all men every where to repent:</hi> now he doth not leave men in the hands of their tranſgreſſions: He doth not winke and let them doe what they liſt; now Goſpel-light is riſen to the world, and there are many ſent out to call in and reclaim wandering prodigals, many to cry, <hi>Return, return.</hi> He ſpeaks of it as of the mercy and priviledge of that age, beyond what the former ages had enjoyed. That of the ſame Apoſtle hath a parallel ſenſe (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. &amp; 26.) where deſcribing the dealings of God with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who ſinned againſt the light of nature, he concludes, Therefore God left them in the darkneſſe of nature, in the worſt of nature: they came not up ſo high, as the principles of nature might have led them in the worſhip of God, therefore he left them below the principles of nature in the things of man, <hi>He gave them up to vile affect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Hands and power are aſcribed to ſinne, becauſe God gives men over to thoſe puniſhments which their ſins challenge at his hands. Some ſinnes have a louder voice then others; but every ſinne unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned (the mouth whereof is not ſtopt by the bloud of Chriſt) cries to God for vengeance, till God put the ſinner into the hand of ſin, that he may at once receive pay for, and from his own folly.

                     <p>This is a generall truth, though we cannot draw it down to the inſtance of <hi>Jobs</hi> children: The Lord in wrath leaves man to himſelf.

The Lord doth not only puniſh men according to their ſins, but he makes their ſinne their puniſhment, yea, their ſins are their puniſhers.

The way of ſinne is death, as well as the end or wages of it. <hi>As faith the Proverb of the Ancients</hi> (they are the words of <hi>David</hi> concerning <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 24.14.) <hi>Wickedneſſe proceedeth from the wicked, but mine hand ſhall not be upon him. David</hi> knew that <hi>Saul</hi> was a man ſo wicked, that he needed no other revenger but his own ſelf, his own ſinne would bring miſery enough upon him: therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Wickedneſſe proceedeth from the wicked,</hi> that is, the puniſhment of wickedneſſe proceedeth from the wicked man himſelf. Obſerve the occaſion of thoſe words, it was, when ſome about <hi>David</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to ſlay <hi>Saul;</hi> not I, ſaith he, <hi>my hand ſhall not be upon him,</hi> I know he is a man ſo given up to ſinne, ſo enſlaved to his own vile affections, that ther's enough upon him already, and in a ſhort time more will be upon him, <hi>Wickedneſſe proceedeth from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but mine hand ſhall not be upon him;</hi> I will leave him to the hand of his ſin, which is his plague already, and which in a little time will attach him, and doe me right, though he never would. When God took up a reſolution againſt his own people, that he would not hear or be intreated, and proteſted his minde could not be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, he ſaith (Jer. 15.2.) <hi>Let them go forth, ſuch as are for the ſword to the ſword; and ſuch as are for the famine, to the famine; and ſuch as are for the captivity, to the captivity.</hi> This was a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſentence; but for God to ſay to a people, Let them go forth in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51057:16"/> the waies of their ſinne; he that is for drunkenneſſe, to be drunk; he that is for uncleanneſſe, to be unclean; he that is for pride, to be proud; he that is for ſwearing to oaths; and he that is for envy, to be envious; and he that is for idolatry, to his idols. O how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably miſerable are ſuch a people! To be left in the hand of theſe ſins, is a ſpirituall judgement; and theſe ſinnes will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring in temporall judgements, and not long hence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</p>

                     <p>God will ſinke and caſt men away for their tranſgreſſions: If ſinne be in the houſe, puniſhment lies at the doors, and will turn the lock and open it, or break it open upon the ſinner.

                     <p>It was an ancient cuſtome to ſeek God in the morning (take it in the letter) early in the morning. <hi>David</hi> profeſſes this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>My voice ſhalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord, in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.</hi> And Heathens, by the light of nature, took this courſe in their profane and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious worſhip.<note place="margin">Herodot <hi>l</hi> 10.

And the Primitive Chriſtians were wondered at for their early devotions. <hi>Pliny</hi> in an Epiſtle to <hi>Trajan,</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> in his Apologeticks for the Chriſtians, report their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, before day-break to pray and call upon God. And there hath been, and ſtill is a ſuperſtitious abuſe of this among the Papiſts, who call their morning prayers, their <hi>Mattins,</hi> becauſe they begin early in the morning.</p>
                     <p>Hence, obſerve, Firſt,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prayer is our ſeeking unto God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That's the generall deſcription of prayer. When we pray, our work is to get neer to God, to finde God; every ſoul that praies
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51057:17"/> indeed, feeles it ſelfe at a loſſe for ſomewhat, that God only can beſtow. In God all that we want is to be found, and therefore he invites us to ſeek him. In this life the Saints are a generation of ſeekers: in the next, they ſhall be a generation of enjoyers; when God is fully found, there's nothing more to be ſought: Having him, we have all. The work of heaven is to bleſſe God for what we have found, not to ſeek him for what we want.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>God muſt be ſought unto without delay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As it is with vows, ſo with prayers, <hi>Deferre not to pay them;</hi> deferre not to pray, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Seek him whileſt he may be found,</hi> Matth. 6.33. <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God;</hi> firſt in time; not only chiefly, but early, put not God behinde in the later end of the day, or in the later end of your buſineſſes. It is beſt to begin with him who is beſt.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>God muſt be ſought unto with diligence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We muſt lay our ſtrength and ſpirits out in ſeeking God. It is not a ſleight enquiry which findes out God. We read that he is found of ſome who ſeek him not at all, but that he is found of any, who ſeek him negligently, we read not. Free-grace prevents thoſe who have no ability to ſeek him, but it meets not thoſe who will not lay out their abilities in ſeeking him. <hi>If thou wouldeſt ſeek unto God betimes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>And make thy ſupplication to the Almighty.</q>
                     <p>The word which we tranſlate <hi>[Make thy ſupplication]</hi> is very ſignificant of the manner how we ſhould ſeek unto God, namely,<note place="margin">Verbum <gap reason="foreign">

A thought of our own worth is inconſiſtent with a <hi>ſupplication; Call upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty for pity,</hi> ſaith M. <hi>Broughton,</hi> when we ſupplicate, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that to be done for us, for which there is no reaſon in us why it ſhould be done. <hi>To make ſupplication:</hi> is to ſeek help and relief freely or <hi>gratis,</hi> acknowledging there is nothing in us worthy love. That <hi>adverb</hi> uſed in the firſt, and repeated in the ſecond Chapter, where the devil objects, <hi>Doth Job ſerve God for nought,</hi> that is, without reſpect of good pay for his pains from God, that <hi>adverb</hi> (I ſay) comes from this <hi>verb.</hi> As we ought to ſerve God (in this ſenſe) for nought, and not like mercenaries for our hire: So God helps us for nought, without looking to any thing in us, or from us, as an hire of his help. The <hi>Baptiſt</hi> had his name <hi>(John)</hi> from this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51057:18"/> word, either becauſe he preached the free-grace of God in Chriſt, then exhibited; or, becauſe God beſtowed him upon his parents in their old-age, as a ſpeciall grace and favour: <hi>The poor</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 18.23.) <hi>uſeth intreaties;</hi> ſome render it thus, <hi>The poor maketh, or speaketh ſupplications;</hi> a poor man hath nothing of deſert to plead, why he ſhould receive your charity, but he lies at your feet, and begs ſomewhat, becauſe he is in want, becauſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath arreſted and taken hold upon him: <hi>The poor uſeth intreaties,</hi> he doth not call for any thing of right, and he will not wreſt any thing from you by force; he only ſupplicates your favour. We in our drawing nigh unto God ſhould pray for grace and favour, as a poor man, begging an alms, who makes this his plea, that he is poor. So then, <hi>Bildads</hi> counſell to <hi>Job</hi> is this, <hi>Stand not upon thy tearms with God, plead not thine own integrity and good works,</hi> but caſt thy ſelf at his feet for mercy, <hi>Make thy ſupplication unto him.</hi> The word is uſed by <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 3.23. when he deſcribeth his own unbelief, for which God ſaid he ſhould not goe into <hi>Canaan, And I beſought the Lord at that time, ſaying,</hi> &amp;c. When <hi>Moſes</hi> perceived God was angry, he did not reckon his former good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to balance this failing, but he ſought unto God for mercy, as one that had never done him any ſervice at all. And as man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes his deſires of free-grace by this word, ſo doth the Lord his higheſt actings of it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. <hi>I will be gracious unto whom I will be gracious.</hi> To ſhew, that to <hi>make ſupplication,</hi> is, to deſire the Lord to be gracious: and that to be gracious is to doe that, which is deſired <hi>by a ſupplication;</hi> the ſame word in the Hebrew ſignifies, both an act of loweſt humility in us, namely the making a ſupplication, and an act of the higheſt grace in God, namely the granting of a ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>In ſeeking God we muſt look to receive all from his free-grace and undeſerved favour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seek unto God, and make thy ſupplication to him.</hi> Mercy in God is the ſpring of all the mercies received by man. What can a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, who comes to a King, ask upon deſert? That's the condition of every one that comes to God: we are a company of beggars, the riches both of temporall and ſpiritual bleſſings are treaſur'd up in God. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in spirit,</hi> they who look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as mean and low, as not having a rag of goodneſſe about them, as emptied of themſelves, are the veſſels which God will fill, <hi>He that is full loatheth a honey-comb,</hi> and he that thinks he is full, is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51057:18"/> loathed ſo much by God, that his reall emptines ſhall never be filled. When <hi>Jacob</hi> held God ſo faſt that he would not let him go without a bleſſing, he had quite let go all hold, yea, or opinion of his worthines to receive a bleſſing, <hi>I am leſſe then the leaſt of all thy mercies</hi> (Gen. 32.10.) Then we are fit to receive great things from God, when we are little, &amp; then fitteſt, when we are leaſt in our own eyes. Yea, we muſt ſupplicate God, not only as a beggar, but as a traitour or a rebell doth a King: who hath not only nothing in him to commend him to his acceptance, or procure his favour, but much to provoke his wrath, and incurre the weight of his diſpleaſure. Every ſinne in it ſelf renders us rebels againſt God. And though his own people, comming unto him in Chriſt, are under another notion, they are his ſonnes, yet, even they ought to have ſuch apprehenſions of themſelves for ſinne. <hi>Abraham believed in him that juſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi> Rom. 4.5. Even <hi>Abraham,</hi> after he was juſtified in the ſight of God through faith, looked upon himſelf as ungodly, in reference to his own works. In all our approaches to God, we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon our ſelves, not only as having many wants, and no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, but as having many ſinnes, and (of our own) no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. God (in juſtice) viſits iniquity upon them that hate him (Exod. 20.6.) <hi>And he ſheweth mercy unto thouſands of them that love him, and keep his Commandments;</hi> They who love God and keep his Commandments, receive all from mercy. Juſtice puniſheth thoſe who break the Commandment, but mercy doth them good who keep the Commandments. <hi>We have at any time ſin enough to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the wrath of God; but we never have goodneſſe enough to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit his favour.</hi> And as no objection from our ſinfulneſſe can obſtruct the way of free-grace from moving towards us: ſo no argument from our holineſſe can open the way, for free-grace to move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us. In all our duties we are to lie in the duſt, yea, we are to lay our duties in the duſt, and to ſeek all of God in humble ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications.</p>
                     <p>Conſider this verſe in connexion with the former, and then two points are obſervable from it. <hi>Bildad</hi> aſſuring <hi>Job,</hi> that though his ſons had fallen by their ſinne, yet, if himſelf would ſeek unto God, and make his ſupplication it might be well with him, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That the fals of others, whether into ſinne, or under judgement for ſin, ſhould be warnings to us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thou ſeeſt what is become of thy ſons: let them be as a looking-glaſſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51057:19"/> for thee. Children may teach their parents, parents are often whipt upon their childrens backs. The hand of God upon others points towards us, and while they are ſmitten we are inſtructed. The Apoſtle ſummes up the moſt remarkable judgements which fell upon the Jews in their paſſage from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all with this application to Chriſtians, <hi>Theſe things happened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them as enſamples, and they are written for our admonition,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the intent that we ſhould not luſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. As if he had ſaid, God let them fall into the hand of their ſinnes, and their fals may help us to keep our feet. Their fals were <hi>types</hi> (ſo the word is) theſe things happened unto them <hi>typically,</hi> in them we may ſee what God will doe with us, if we take their courſe, and goe their way.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Make thy ſupplication, ſeek unto God, but be thou pure and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</hi> What have unholy perſons to doe about holy things? God cannot like the ſervices of thoſe who are unlike him. Prayer puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, yet purifying muſt be a preparative to prayer. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.18. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart</hi> (if I lodge filthineſſe there) <hi>God will not bear me;</hi> he will not regard my prayer. The blinde man ſaw this truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.31. (it ſeems this was a received maxime among them) <hi>God heareth not ſinners.</hi> We are commanded to pray, <hi>left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up pure hands,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.8. An Heathen being at ſea in a great ſtorm, and perceiving many wicked wretches with him in the ſhip, calling upon the gods,<note place="margin">Silete (inquit) ne vos hic na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigare dij ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiant. <hi>Bias.</hi>

                        <hi>O</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>forbear prayer, hold your tongues, I would not have the gods take notice that you are here, they will ſure drown us all if they doe.</hi> If an Heathen by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could ſay this, much more may we by the light of Scripture, <hi>That God heareth not ſinners,</hi> Iſa. 1. <hi>When you spread forth your

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The prayers of the pure and upright are prevailing prayers.</hi>

                     <p>In the next words God awakes, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>The effectuall fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi> Fervency of prayer effects nothing, unleſſe the perſon praying be righteous, God is not melted into compaſſion by the heat of our words, but by the holineſſe of our hearts. In the prayer of a righteous man there is ſtrength, prevailing ſtrength, ſuch, as God himſelf yeelds to. <hi>As a Prince thou haſt power with God, and haſt prevailed,</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Jacob</hi> when he wreſtled with him. Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is no way contrary to the doctrine of free-grace to ſay we must be holy, if we deſire to be heard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bildads</hi> doctrine is an excellent piece of Divinity, Though he ſaid before, Thou muſt ſeek unto God, and make ſupplication to him, that out of his free-grace he would beſtow a bleſſing upon thee, yet he adds, <hi>If thou were pure and upright.</hi> Though we are not heard, becauſe we are pure and upright, yet none can come with a warrantable confidence to be heard in their impurity and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie: if they do, God will reject their confidences, and they ſhall not proſper in them. It is impudence, not confidence, to make ſupplication to God with a reſerve, or a reſolve in ſecret, to go on in ſinne. The greateſt ſinners in the world may come to God, they that are moſt impure and filthy, may finde favour; yet every man that commeth unto God, muſt come with this deſire, to have his impurities removed, and his backſlidings healed, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the wicked, ſaith God, What hast thou to doe to declare my ſtatutes, or to take my covenant in thy mouth, ſeeing thou hatest inſtrustion, and caſtest my words behinde thee,</hi> Pſal. 50.16. It no way croſſes the doctrine of grace, when with the ſame breath we ſay, God will doe us good freely for his own names ſake, and that, we muſt be pure and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right who come to God, <hi>With the pure thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf pure, and with the upright man thou w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51057:21"/> as the company changes? That's the weakneſſe of ſinfull man, he cannot doe ſo, with whom there is no variableneſſe nor ſhadow of changing. God is pure and upright with the unclean and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall, as well as with the pure and upright, and his actions ſhew him to be ſo. God ſhews himſelf froward with the froward, when he deals with them, as he hath ſaid he will deal with the froward; deny them, and reject them. God ſhews himſelf pure with the pure, when he deals with them as he hath ſaid he will; hear them and accept them. Though there be nothing in purity and ſincerity, which deſerveth mercy, yet we cannot expect mercy without them. Our comforts are not grounded upon our graces, but our comforts are the fruits or conſequents of our graces.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bildad</hi> having ſhewed <hi>Job</hi> his duty, ſhews him a promiſe of mercy, <hi>If thou wert pure and upright, ſurely now he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake for thee.</hi> There is a three-fold gradation of mercie in this promiſe.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That God would Awake for him.</item>
                        <item>2. That God would Proſper, or pacifie his habitation.</item>
                        <item>3. That God would Abundantly encreaſe and multiply him in his later end.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>The firſt ſtep of mercy, is, <hi>That God would awake for him.</hi> Surely now he would awake for thee. And there are three things obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about this.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The certainty of it, in the word <hi>[Surely]</hi> without all doubt or peradventure, if thou wouldeſt thus ſeek to him, <hi>He would awake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, The ſpeedineſſe of it; <hi>Surely now</hi> he would awake, <hi>[Now]</hi> without delay or demurre; thou ſhouldeſt no ſooner ſeek to God, but finde an anſwer of mercy from him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The benefit of it to <hi>Job, He would awake for thee.</hi> For <hi>Job</hi> might ſay,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                        </note> I may awaken a ſleepie Lion to riſe up againſt me; God may be angry with my prayer, and in ſtead of bleſſing pour out ſome further judgement upon me: No, ſaith <hi>Bildad,</hi> I aſſure thee, if thou thus ſeek to him, <hi>He will awake for thee,</hi> not againſt thee.</p>
                     <p>God ſometimes awakes againſt us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.28. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe, that as I have watched over them, to pluck up and to break down, and to deſtroy; and to afflict, ſo will I watch over them to build and to plant, ſaith the Lord.</hi> As the Lord would watch to doe them a good turn; ſo he had watcht to doe them (as we ſpeak) a ſhrewd
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51057:21"/> turn. He threatens them with ſuch a watchfulneſſe, Chap. 44.27. <hi>I will watch over them for evil, and not for good.</hi> When we are dull and ſleepy in doing the will of God, he will be watchfull and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to afflict us. And when men cannot ſleep till they doe evil, God will not ſleep till he brings evil. So, <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the ninth of that Prophecy and the 14. verſe, having humbled himſelf before God in prayer and faſting, and confeſſed the ſins of the people, concludes, <hi>Therefore hath the Lord watched upon the evil, and brought it upon us.</hi> God not only awakes, but watches to doe a people e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who have long abuſed his goodneſſe; As men in maliciouſneſſe of ſpirit watch for advantages, and ſpie out opportunities to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge themſelves, <hi>All my familiars watch for my halting,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Chap.</hi> 20.12. So the Lord in abundant holineſſe and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of juſtice, though with a great deal of wrath and ſeverity, watches to revenge himſelf of a wicked people. He takes all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and advantages againſt them, <hi>Thou haſt watched evil, and brought it upon us.</hi> His love to a returning people is as vigilant, as his anger againſt a blackſliding people.</p>

It is frequent in Scripture to call the repairing of a mans eſtate, or the bringing of good to him, the raiſing of him up, <hi>He raiſeth the poor out of the duſt;</hi> he awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens them out of that low condition. <hi>Job</hi> was in the duſt, and his children in the grave, God made a reſurrection of both for him.

                        <hi>He will awake.]</hi> The Pſalmiſt aſſures us (Pſal. 121.4.) <hi>He that keepeth Iſrael doth neither ſlumber nor ſleep.</hi> God never ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51057:22"/> How is it then ſaid, that God awakes?</p>
                     <p>For the opening of this metaphor; Firſt, As, The Church confeſſes and profeſſes (Cant. 5.2.) <hi>I ſleep, but my heart waketh;</hi> when the Church is aſleep, yet her heart is awake towards God: So much more, when in regard of outward providences God ſeems to be aſleep, his heart is awake toward his Church, his heart (<hi>ſcil.</hi> his affection, &amp;c.) never ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, God is ſaid to ſleep, when he doth not anſwer our prayers; and when he hears prayer, then he is ſaid to awake. Hence the Septuagint render this text,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </note> not as we, <hi>He will awake;</hi> but, <hi>He will hear thy prayer for deliverance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, God ſleeps, not in regard of the act, but the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of ſleep. Naturall ſleep is the binding or locking up of the ſenſes. The eye and ear of God is never bound. But to mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion the affairs of the world paſſe, as if God did neither hear nor ſee. When men are aſleep things are done, which they can take no notice of, much leſſe ſtop and prevent. The Parable tels us (Mat. 13.) <hi>While men ſlept, the envious man came and ſowed tares:</hi> While the houſholder ſlept, the thief brake the houſe: and the Phariſees direct the watchmen to ſay of Chriſt in the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, <hi>While we ſlept his Diſciples came and ſtole him away.</hi> So now, when things are ſo carried in the world, as if the God of heaven did not regard or take notice of them;<note place="margin">Dormire vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur cum te re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquit in his calamitatibus. <hi>Druſ.</hi>
                        </note> when he doth not prevent or hinder evil; when he doth not ſtop or reſtrain the rage and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of men; this retiring of himſelf in the way of his providence, is called his ſleep.</p>
                     <p>The complaint runnes high, Pſal. 44.9, &amp;c. <hi>Lord, thou goest not forth with our Armies, we are become a reproach unto our enemies; Thou ſelleſt thy people for nought; we are killed like ſheep all the day long.</hi> There's a deſcription of the confuſion of things, then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth (verſ. 23.) <hi>Awake, why ſleepeſt thou, O Lord? Ariſe, caſt us not off for ever; wherefore hideſt thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppreſſion.</hi> Such a time was accounted the ſleeping time of God.</p>
                     <p>Hence when God in the workings of his providence, ſearcheth out the wicked, and brings them to deſtruction; when he breaks their deſigns, and turns their counſels backwards; when he turns their wickedneſſe upon their own heads, and catches them in the ſnare which they have laid for others, then he is ſaid to awake, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78.65. <hi>He gave his people over to the ſword, and the fire conſumed the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51057:22"/> young men; then the Lord awakened as one out of ſleep, and like a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant refreſhed with wine, He ſmote his enemies in the hinder parts, and put them to a perpetuall ſhame.</hi> Such a time was accounted Gods wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king time.</p>
                     <p>So then, Sleeping and awaking, note only the changes of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. Hence alſo the providence of God is deſcribed by <hi>an eye</hi> 2 Chron. 16.9.) which is the proper organ of ſleeping, or waking; and the exactneſſe of providence, is ſet out by <hi>ſeven eyes,</hi> Zech. 3.9. The Scripture ſpeaks this language in reference to our ſoul-ſleep and awakening. When we ſin and let things goe which way they will in our hearts, without taking any care, or keeping our watch againſt temptation, then we are aſleep in ſinne: And when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to conſider our eſtates, and return to our ſelves, when we take notice how it is with us, and ask our hearts the queſtion, <hi>What have we done?</hi> This in a ſpirituall ſenſe is our awakening, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt,</hi> Epheſ. 5.14. Our ſpirituall ſleeping and waking are the decaies or quicknings of ſoul-endeavours. And Gods providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall ſleeping and waking are the ſeeming ſtops and viſible motions of his power, mercy and juſtice in the world. This is the awaking which <hi>Bildad</hi> promiſes. <hi>If thou wouldeſt ſeek God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Surely he would awake for thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The words opened teach us.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That holy prayer ſhall certainly be heard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If thou make thy ſupplication to him, ſurely he will awake.</hi> God cannot ſleep when a poor believing ſoul cries in his ears, <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear my prayer</hi> (Pſal. 66.18.) <hi>But verily God hath heard me, he hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.</hi> What, God turn prayer away? No, he cannot lie ſtill (as I may ſo ſpeak) when prayer knocks at the door, he muſt ariſe and open preſently. That's a ſecond note,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prayer ſhall be heard preſently.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What? preſently? Yes, preſently heard, though not preſently anſwered; <hi>Surely now he will awaken for thee, even now.</hi> Holy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are never deferred the hearing, no not a minute, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.24. <hi>Before they call I will hear, and while they are yet speaking I will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi> In the very act of praying the anſwer came forth: yea the anſwer ſometimes antedates our asking, and the grant commeth before the petition. The giving out of the anſwer may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, but the anſwer is not deferr'd. We may be heard, and heard graciouſly, and yet not preſently receive the thing we ask; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51057:23"/> prayer is heard and laid up, aſſoon as put up; he hangs it upon the file, he hath it ſafe by him. Prayer receives an anſwer in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, aſſoon as ſpoken upon earth, though the anſwer be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to us on earth. <hi>God ſleeps not at the prayer of thoſe who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake in prayer.</hi> Thirdly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prayer is the best means to awaken God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God hath many waies to awaken man; and he hath directed man a way to awaken himſelf. When we are aſleep he awakeneth us chiefly two waies: Firſt, by the voice of his word: Secondly, by the voice of his rod. He now awakens us by the loud ſounding trumpet, and the alarms of warre: when God awakeneth us by judgements, it is time for us to awaken him by prayer. We finde two things in Scripture which awaken God. Firſt, the prayers of his own people. And ſecondly, the rage and blaſphemy of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.65. The Prophet having deſcribed the cruelty and rage of the enemy, adds, <hi>Then the Lord awaked as one out of ſleep, and like a mighty man that ſhouteth by reaſon of wine: David</hi> makes this an argument in prayer, (Pſal. 7.) <hi>Becauſe of the rage of mine enemies awake for me to the judgement which thou hast commanded.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Lord, ſhall mine enemies rage, and wilt thou ſleep? Wilt not thou awake for me? Ariſe, I pray thee. The noiſe of blaſphemy, and the cry of violence from wicked men, ſtir up God when he ſeems to lie aſleep. The noiſe of prayer, the cries and cals of faith in his own people, will not let him ſleep. A man whoſe heart is drenched in the world, and drowned in rivers of earthly pleaſures, praies himſelf aſleep, and his prayers bring God aſleep to: he ſleeps when he praies, and God ſleeps at his prayers, that is, God regards not his prayer; he is as one that ſleepeth, as if he heard not what was ſaid. A wordly man doth not hear what he ſpeaks, he knows not what his own requeſts are. God ſleepeth when men are thus aſleep. But when we (as the Apoſtle directs) <hi>watch and pray,</hi> then God awakes at our prayers. As in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe <hi>Job</hi> was counſelled to awake to pray to God, ſo now he is promiſed, That the Lord will awake when he praieth.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Seeing the Lord is awakened by prayer. W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> learn, That</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prayer ought to be very ſtrong and fervent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As men are graduall in their ſleep, ſo is the Lord in his. A man is ſometimes ſo ſlumberingly aſleep that the leaſt noiſe will awake him, you cannot ſtirre, but he will hear it. At another time a man is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51057:23"/> ſo dead aſleep, that though you hollow in his ear you cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake him, thunder cannot ſtirre him. Sometimes God departs ſo little, that the leaſt voice calleth him again, he comes at the firſt word; at another time he is gone ſo farre, that (as to a man in a deep ſleep) you muſt crie and cry again, call and call again, cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud before he hears. And we may (in a ſafe ſenſe) apply that to the true God, which <hi>Elijah</hi> did to that falſe god, <hi>Baal;</hi> when his Prieſts were calling to him from morning to night, <hi>Elijah</hi> mocking, bids them <hi>cry aloud, it may be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he ſleepeth:</hi> We may ſay (with reverence) thus, when any pray to God, and he doth not hear, pray aloud; not in regard of the voice and outward ſound, but pray with louder deſires of heart, with more fervency and zeal of ſpirit, <hi>Peradventure God ſleepeth;</hi> peradventure he is in a deep ſleep at this time, and he will not ſuddenly be awakened, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cry aloud. When God ſeemed to depart farre from the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> with how much fervency do they cry after him (Iſa. 51.9.) <hi>Awake, awake, put on ſtrength, O arm of the Lord, awake, as in the ancient daies,</hi> &amp;c? They double and treble it upon him, and cry with an out-ſtretched voice, <hi>Art not thou he that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?</hi> What a clamour, what a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtirre was here, to awaken God. God himſelf ſometimes ſeems (as it were) willing to take his reſt; as when he ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Let me alone;</hi> he ſpake like a man that is in bed, or very ſleepy, <hi>Doe not trouble me, let me alone;</hi> as he in the Goſpel (<hi>Luk.</hi> 11.7.) when he was awakened in the night to come and give bread unto his neighbour, <hi>Doe not trouble me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the doors are ſhut, and I am in bed with my children, I cannot riſe and give thee, let me alone.</hi> Thus in ſome ſenſe the Lord expreſſes himſelf to his people, I am now in bed, doe not trouble me, <hi>Let me alone.</hi> What muſt we do in this caſe? We muſt knock harder at the door, as he in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel did, <hi>For whom, though his neighbour would not riſe and give him, becauſe he was his friend, yet becauſe of his importunity he riſes and gives him as many loaves as he needed.</hi> We muſt be the more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to awake God, by how much he ſeems more unwilling to hear us; our modeſty (in this caſe) pleaſes him not: we muſt call and call again: He will take it well at our hands, if we doe ſo. We muſt give our ſelves no reſt, and let him take none; ſo the Prophet reſolves (Iſa. 62.1.) <hi>For Jeruſalems ſake, I will take no rest,</hi> I will never give over praying; and at the ſixth verſe, <hi>I have ſet watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men upon thy wals, O Jeruſalem, which ſhall never hold their peace
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51057:24"/> day nor night, you that make mention of the Lord, keep not ſilence, and give him no reſt, till he eſtabliſh, and till he make Jeruſalem a praiſe in the earth.</hi> If the Lord ſhould carry it in the preſent anſwers of his providence, as if he were willing to reſt, and deſired not to be troubled in this buſineſſe; be not you ſo put off: but with a holy boldneſſe and confidence come to him and awaken him: take no anſwer, till ye have an anſwer. He is beſt pleaſed and moſt at eaſe, when (in prayer) we give him no reſt. Laſtly, Obſerve,</p>

                     <p>If the eye of God be upon us for good, that brings us in all good: therefore (<hi>Zech.</hi> 2. ult.) when the Church was in her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Prophet concludes with an exultation of ſpirit, <hi>Be ſilent, O all fleſh, before the Lord, for he is raiſed up out of his holy habitation;</hi> it is this word, <hi>He is awaked out of his holy habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, now be ſilent, O all fleſh, before the Lord:</hi> All fleſh, ye that are the wicked of the world, ye that are enemies, be ye ſilent, leave your boaſting, your reproaching and blaſpheming, for the Lord is awaked, now he begins to ſtirre for his people, he will ſtop your mouths ſhortly: <hi>All fleſh,</hi> takes in the Church and people of God too, <hi>O be ye ſilent,</hi> in regard of your fears and doubtings, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and diſtracted complainings, ſilence all theſe, why? <hi>The Lord is awaked, he is raiſed up out of his holy habitation;</hi> that is, he that ſeemed before to confine himſelf to thoſe higher regions, and as the Atheiſt ſpeaks in <hi>Job,</hi> to walk in the circle of the heavens, not intermedling with the earth: This God is now awaked, he is raiſed out of his holy habitation, and now ye ſhall know that he orders all things here below: therefore be ſilent, O all fleſh. When Chriſt was aſleep (<hi>Matth.</hi> 8.25.) <hi>A grievous tempeſt aroſe</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>inſomuch as the Ship was covered with waves.</hi> When ſtorms and tempeſts are upon the Church, God is then aſleep, though even then he directs the ſtorms, and gives law to the proud waves. But what did the Diſciples in this ſtorm? <hi>They awoke Chriſt, Maſter, ſave us, we periſh;</hi> and aſſoon as ever Chriſt was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened, <hi>He rebuked the ſtorme, and there was a great calm.</hi> Thus, when we are toſt up and down with contrary windes, and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be ſplit and ſunke, if God once awake, all is calm. <hi>How quietly may they ſleep for whom God wakes.</hi> I doe not ſay they ſhould ſleep careleſly, but confidently they may.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51057:24"/> 
                        <hi>who</hi> (indeed) <hi>never ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth.</hi> And if God awake not for us, all our watchfulneſſe is as uſeleſſe to us, as our ſleepineſſe, <hi>The watchman waketh but in vain, except the Lord keep the City.</hi> Except he awake our watching can doe no good; and if he awake, good will come, though we be aſleep. It is our duty to be carefull, and it is our comfort that the care of God is enough for us. <hi>The eye of divine providence helps us in many humane impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences.</hi> What their happineſſe is for whom God awakes, ſee in the next words.</p>
                     <q>He will make the habitation of thy righteouſneſſe prosperous.</q>
                     <p>This is the ſecond degree or ſtep of mercy promiſed; when the Lord awakes, he vvill awake to purpoſe. We ſay of ſome men, <hi>Early up, and never the near;</hi> They awake, and doe little work: but if God awakes, ſee what he doth,

                     <p>Righteouſneſſe is a very comprehenſive word. The Philoſopher tels us, it takes in all other vertues whatſoever, <hi>It is not a part of vertue, but all vertue.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When righteouſneſſe is ſet as diſtinct from holineſſe and piety, then it is reſtrained to our dealings with men. <hi>Righteouſneſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to men, and holineſſe to God, Luk.</hi> 1.75. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12.

                     <p>But righteouſneſſe here takes in our whole duty, whether to God or man, <hi>The habitation of thy righteouſneſſe;</hi> that is, the place where thou exerciſeſt all manner of holy and righteous duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God and toward man. Righteouſneſſe toward man, firſt, in diſtributive juſtice, giving every one his due in judgement, as thou art a Magiſtrate: Secondly, Righteouſneſſe towards man in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutative juſtice, giving every one his due in commerce, as thou art a neighbour.</p>
                     <q>The habitation of thy righteouſneſſe.</q>
                     <p>It is an elegant expreſſion. The Church is ſometimes called ſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.23. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of hoſts, the God of Iſrael, as yet they ſhall uſe this speech in the land of Judah, and in the Cities thereof, when I ſhall bring again their captivity.

                     <p>God himſelf is ſtiled, <hi>The habitation of righteouſneſſe,</hi> becauſe he (in a way of higheſt excellency, or in the moſt ſuperlative degree) is the ſeat of righteouſneſſe; all righteouſneſſe is (as it were)

If he had not made an habitation of righteouſneſſe in the world, there had never been an habitation of peace in the world: in that work of his, the foundation of our proſperity was laid. Jeſus Chriſt, who as a Prieſt purchaſed our peace, is alſo, The <hi>King of righteouſneſſe.</hi> Bleſſings crown the head of a righteous people (Jer. 31.23.) <hi>They ſhall ſay, the Lord bleſſe thee, O habitation of righteouſneſſe.</hi> If thou art a habitation of righteouſneſſe, a bleſſing ſhall reſt upon thee; <hi>The Kingdom of God is not meat and drinke, but righteouſneſſe and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14.17. as the ſpirituall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt: So the joy and peace of worldly Kingdoms, is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſſe. When Kingdoms are holy habitations, they will ſoon be quiet habitations. In Iſa. 26.2. <hi>Open ye the gates that the righteous Nation which keepeth the truth may enter in; thou ſhalt keep him in perfect peace.</hi> God will give and preſerve the peace of the righteous. Righteouſneſſe is the pillar of a State, and the parent of peace. <hi>The mountains</hi> (Pſal. 72.3.) <hi>ſhall bring peace to the people, and the little hils by righteouſneſſe.</hi> Plant righteouſneſſe upon barren hils and mountains, and peace will flouriſh there.</p>

                     <p>I might hence inferre a corollary, by the rule of contrarie, That <hi>

The next words give a reaſon, <hi>They ſhall call thee, the border of wickednes, the people againſt whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.</hi> Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is a large word, and takes in all unrighteouſneſſe towards man, as well as impiety towards God. <hi>That building cannot ſtand long, where unrighteouſnes lies between the timber and the ſtones. God will pull down by night, what ſuch men build by day.</hi> If then we would have buildings ſtand, and our habitations proſperous, let us labour to build with juſtice, and make ours, the habitations of righteouſneſſe. Look upon it in families, that which withers the comfort of a family, in children, in ſervants, is the unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe found in a family; if there be unrighteouſneſſe there, no wonder, if there be decaies and diſcontents there too.

                     <p>Tedious delaies make Courts, priſons of righteouſneſſe, not habitations of righteouſneſſe. Partiall diſtributions ſhew a place to be a market of righteouſneſſe (where he ſhall have it that bid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> moſt for it) not an habitation of righteouſneſſe, where every one ought to have it that comes for it; <hi>Ye ſhall do no unrighteouſneſſe in judgement</hi> (ſaith the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.15.) how ſhall they avoid it? The next words give direction, <hi>Thou ſhalt not respect the perſon of the poor, nor honour the perſon of the mighty.</hi> Righteouſneſſe takes not notice of the perſons of men, but of their cauſes. We muſt not do unrighteouſly in charity to the poor, as well as not in hopes, or for gifts from the rich.</p>
                     <p>Again, The Hebrew ſignifies a beautifull habitation. Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe loves to dwell in a fair houſe. It is ſo, when, firſt ſwept from bribes, theſe are filth in the houſe, and the corrupters of righteouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A beautifull houſe hath ſtore of lights in it. Juſtice and truth love not corners and cloſe cels. Juſtice muſt act clearly: men cannot bear it, that, what fals upon their ſenſes, ſhould not be in the light of their underſtandings. God hath ſecret judgements, but man muſt not. One potſheard muſt ſhew another, why he forms or breaks him thus in judgement.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The beauty of the houſe of juſtice ariſes from good Laws, and good men to execute them. Righteouſneſſe cannot act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a rule; and rules cannot act themſelves. Good Laws without good Magiſtrates never made any people a habitation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. It is not good Laws, but good men which make a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome happy. Now, as unrighteouſnes makes a ſtrong people weak, a rich people poor, an honourable people baſe, a great eſtate to decreaſe, and come to nothing: So righteouſneſſe makes a weak people ſtrong, a poor people rich, a mean people honourable, a little eſtate encreaſe and come to much. Thus <hi>Bildad</hi> aſſures <hi>Job</hi> with his next breath.</p>

The ſenſe is good either way.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If we underſtand it of his eſtate before and after his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles compared together, Though thy beginning or the firſt eſtate which God gave thee were ſmall, yet thy later end, or the eſtate which God will give thee, when theſe ſtorms are over-blown ſhall wonderfully encreaſe.</p>
                     <p>Againſt this it may be objected, How can the former eſtate of <hi>Job</hi> be called <hi>ſmall,</hi> when as it is ſaid (Chap. 1.) that <hi>Job</hi> had a very vaſt eſtate? We have heard the inventory of his goods, the totall ſumme or apprizement of all, being given in by God himſelf, <hi>That Job was the greateſt of all the men in the Eaſt.</hi> How then can it be ſaid, that his firſt eſtate was ſmall? <hi>Though thy beginning were ſmall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, comparatively it may be called ſmall. An exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceſſe of greatneſſe, leſſens and littles any other greatneſſe. The Moone is a great light, but the light of the Sunne makes that light darkneſſe. That which is glorious hath no glory, by reaſon of the glory that excelleth; he that is rich or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51057:28"/> great hath no riches or greatneſſe, by reaſon of riches and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which excell. <hi>Job</hi> had a fair eſtate before, and was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man of all the men of the Eaſt; but his eſtate is promiſed to be ſuch as ſhall obſcure the former, and render it inconſiderable. Accordingly, it is ſaid, in the ſtory of his reſtoring (Chap. 42.10.) <hi>That the Lord turned the captivity of Job; alſo the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.</hi> Half is but a little to the whole. And at the 12. verſe, <hi>The Lord bleſſed the later end of Job more then his beginning.</hi> Which words are a good expoſition upon the text in hand. When <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſent for his father and brethren to come into <hi>Aegypt</hi> (Gen. 45.20.) he ſaith, but <hi>as for your ſtuff, do not regard that, for the good of all the land of Aegypt is before you. Joſeph</hi> knew his father was a rich man. <hi>Jacob</hi> was no beggar: but let all that go for nothing, leave it to thoſe that will take it up, all the good of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> is before you, what is all you have to the <hi>riches of Aegypt?</hi> That's the firſt ſenſe.</p>

                     <p>We complain of loſſes; I have loſt a great eſtate, ſaith one, but the Lord is able to give thee ſuch an eſtate, as that the greatneſſe of the former ſhall not be remembred.</p>

                        <hi>Iob</hi> was great above all others in the Eaſt, but now he ſhall be made greater then himſelf. As in ſpirituals, they that have, to them more ſhall be given, and they ſhall have more abundance; ſo they that loſe much in temporals, to them more is given ſometimes then they have loſt, and they ſhall have abundance.</p>
                     <p>There is a ſecond ſenſe, to which the letter of the originall doth rather incline, which makes both parts of the verſe look only to his ſecond eſtate, namely, his reſtauration: and ſo the ſenſe is this, <hi>Though thou doeſt not preſently thrive and grow up to a great eſtate, yet afterward thou ſhalt;</hi> Though after this breaking and undoing thou ſhouldſt ſet up (as it were) but with a little ſtock, one friend bringing thee a peece of ſilver, another, a peece of gold, a third, a jewell, all making a purſe for thee: and ſo thou beginneſt but upon alms and charity, yet thy later end ſhall greatly encreaſe. As if <hi>Bildad</hi> had ſaid, Though God ſhould now begin to comfort, and reſtore thee but with ſmall matters, yet doe not thinke he will ſo conclude with thee, he hath enough in ſtore.

                        <hi>The Lord doth uſually raiſe his people by degrees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They do not receive all at once. It is true of perſons, families and Nations. We muſt not look for all in a day. Outward mercies may come too faſt upon us, there may be a glut of them. We may have more than we know how to order and take in, it may do hurt to receive all together. As it is with men that have been long pined with famine and hunger, and are grown out of their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courſe, by reaſon of their neceſſitated abſtinence: We doe not preſently give them all manner of good cheer, or bring them to a full table, and let them eat as much as they will; but we give them a little and a little at a time, and ſo by degrees bring their ſtomacks on, till they be wrought for plenty. So when the Lord brings perſons or nations very low, he doth not bring in a glut of mercies at firſt, this would be more then they are able to bear, as they may be undone, if they have all at one receit; but he gives they are able to take them in, and make a right uſe of them. As <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid to <hi>Eſau</hi> his brother, when he invited him to march with him; no, ſaith <hi>Iacob,</hi> I cannot march thy pace, I muſt conſider what my train is, I have flocks here that are great with young, <hi>And if I ſhould over-drive them one day, they would all die: therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will lead on ſoftly, according as the cattell that are before me, and the children be able to endure.</hi> So it is in this caſe, the Lord in infinite wiſdome gives, as men are able to receive. <hi>We may be over-mercy'd, as well as over-affli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ted; over-laden with comforts, as well as with ſorrows.</hi> And therefore as the Lord doth correct in judgement and in meaſure: So alſo doth he reſtore. We have not full-tide in a moment, or in a quarter of an hour: it would be terrible, dangerous and troubleſome, if when it is low water we ſhould have full tide in a moment, but it comes in ſtealing by degrees, and at laſt it ſwels all over the banks. Such a ſtealing flood of mercies the Lord gives his people.</p>
                     <p>Therefore be caution'd. In the returns of mercy do not deſpiſe ſmall things. Your beginnings may be inconſiderable, this is but a little, and that is but a little, but doe not deſpiſe the firſt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51057:29"/> or ſecond little. So the Prophet counſels (<hi>Zech.</hi> 4.10.) <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiſe not the day of ſmall things:</hi> The beginnings of mercy were ſcarce diſcernable, and they looked upon them as nothing, they thought they would never come to any thing. Take heed (ſaith the Prophet) doe not deſpiſe ſmall things, there's more a comming. Haſt thou but a little? Doth God make but ſome little repairs of outward comforts? Do not ſleight theſe, look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as the beginnings of greater things. When <hi>Elijah</hi> ſent his ſervant to go and look toward the ſea whether he ſaw any ſign of rain, he at laſt brought him word that he ſaw a little cloud ariſe out of the ſea as big as a mans hand: would any one thinke that a prognoſtick of great rain? <hi>Elijahs</hi> ſervant might deſpiſe this, and ſay this is no ſign of rain; but <hi>Elijah</hi> knew better, that little aſſured him there was a mighty ſhowre at hand, he knew how it would work preſently: Go, bid <hi>Ahab</hi> prepare his Chariot, and get him down, that the rain ſtop him not. Thus it is, reſpecting daily providences; if you ſee a mercy comming but as bigge as a mans hand, be psrſwaded that the Lord ſends it as a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, as that which ſhall uſher in large and extenſive mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. If we ſee the glimmering light of day break, we are not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, becauſe it is not preſently high noon, or, becauſe we have not full light, we know the light will come by degrees; <hi>Thy beginning ſhall be ſmall, but thy later end ſhall greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</hi>

The former cannot warrant us that any thing was regiſtred and written by Gods appointment, till the writing of the Law. And therefore <hi>Bildad,</hi> according to the uſage of thoſe times, ſends <hi>Iob</hi> for information to the traditions and reports of the fathers.

The fathers of the former age, are the fathers of every age. All that have lived before us, come under the relation of our fathers.

                     <p>To what end ſhould <hi>Job</hi> ſearch, if nothing were to be found; The Jews were commanded to remember the works of God for their learning after the word was written, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.5.

                     <p>It was their duty before the word was written, and it is a duty ſtill. The works of God are to be ſtudied and read over as well as his word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.20. &amp; 32. <hi>Ask now of the daies that are past, which were before thee, ſince the day that God created man upon earth; and ask from one ſide of heaven to another, enquire every way to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever God dealt with a people, as he hath dealt with thee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God did ever aſſay to take to himſelf a Nation from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of another Nation by temptations, and by ſigns, and by wonders, &amp;c.</hi> Enquire this of all the former times.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51057:32"/> called the daughter of time, yet (in a ſenſe) it is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of time, for it was before time was; and therefore (no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that which is ancienteſt is trueſt.</p>
                     <p>Yet there is a great abuſe of this principle. Look back to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and conſult with your fathers (ſay many) and ſee what they did, how they believed. But what is the antiquity they call us to conſult with? It is not (as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake in that place of <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy</hi>) antiquity, <hi>ſince God created man upon earth,</hi> or ſince Jeſus Chriſt was upon the earth, and gave out his Goſpel-laws: but it is the antiquity of ſome later ages and editions, an antiquity far ſhort of what is indeed the ancient time. The Apoſtle (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.7.) gives us the definition of an old commandment, <hi>This is the old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment which was from the beginning.</hi> Our ſinfull nature is called the <hi>old man,</hi> and yet it is a <hi>corrupt man.</hi> It is called the <hi>old-man</hi> not that it is older then the <hi>new man;</hi> the <hi>new man</hi> is not of a younger houſe, or later date then the <hi>old man.</hi> Holineſſe was before cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And the image of God upon man, elder then ſinne, the image of the devil. There are many corruptions in doctrine, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, in worſhip, in practice, which go for very old: And there are many doctrines which we call <hi>new truths;</hi> Is it becauſe thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are older then theſe new truths? No, new truths are elder then the oldeſt corruptions. That which we call the <hi>new world,</hi> was created in the beginning, though diſcovered but yeſterday. So new truths were given from the beginning, only they were unknown till of late; and we may well conceive that ſome goodly regions of truth are ſtill <hi>(terra incognita)</hi> undiſcovered; God having reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them for the honour, and induſtry of ſome <hi>divine Columbus,</hi> who may give us an exacter ſea-card of divine myſteries, then the world hath yet ſeen, though enough hath been ſeen from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning for the ſafe ſteering of our courſe to heaven. He that would enquire and make a diligent ſearch for truth, muſt goe to the firſt inſtitutions, <hi>That's the old commandment which was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> (Chap. 23.43.) ſpeaks of ſome who were <hi>grown old in adulteries;</hi> that is, old in adulterating and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting the truth, and worſhip of God, <hi>That which is old may be old in evil, and fuller of errours then it is of daies.</hi> We finde when the good Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> reformed, they did not ſearch only into what was done in the ages immediately before them, or what their next fathers had done, but they ſearcht what was done in the times of their godly fathers, how many removes ſoever diſtant from them.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51057:33"/> 
                        <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.6.) tels the <hi>Levites</hi> that their fathers were in an errour, that they had treſpaſſed, and done that which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in the ſight of the Lord, and had forſaken him; and <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.5. ſpeaking of the obſervation of the Paſſeover, he ſaith, <hi>They had not done it of a long time in ſuch ſort as it was written;</hi> therefore, <hi>v.</hi> 7. he dehorteth them ſaying, <hi>Be not ye like your fathers which tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaſſed againſt the Lord God of your fathers;</hi> he doth not mean that they ſhould not be like their firſt fathers, who had the truth purely committed to them, and ſo worſhipped God purely; but be not like your immediate fore-fathers, or your corrupt fore-fathers, how many deſcents and generations ſo ever, ye can number from them. And this was a thing ſo ſtrange, that when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſent the Poſts from City to City thorow the Countries of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> with this meſſage, that he would have a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to the firſt inſtitution or patern, and would not have them ſtay in what their fore-fathers had done; It is ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>That they laughed the meſſengers to ſcorn, and they mocked them,</hi> what muſt we now be wiſer then our fathers? Yes, ſaith he, you have done evil a long time, you and your fathers, therefore I muſt bring you back to your firſt fathers, in compariſon of whom, the fathers you claim by were but children, and thoſe degenerate chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. It is ſaid of <hi>Joſiah's</hi> reformation (2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.22.) That <hi>there was not the like from the daies of the Judges, nor in all the daies of the Kings of Iſrael and Judah,</hi> he went to the very beginning of all, there had not been ſuch a thing done before. So that if any ſhould have objected, why may not ſuch a reformation ſerve us as ſerved thoſe Kings and Judges? No, ſaith <hi>Joſiah,</hi> I will ſearch what was beyond their time, into the remoteſt antiquities. The Church makes humble confeſſion (Pſal. 106.6.) <hi>We have erred with our fathers;</hi> let not any turn this into a ſtubborn reſolution, and ſay, <hi>We will erre with their fathers:</hi> if that be an errour which our fathers believed and practiſed, we will erre with them. So thoſe rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Jews pleaded (Jer. 44.17.) <hi>We will doe as our fathers.</hi> They who will doe as their fathers, may ſuffer with their fathers; they who will needs erre by their fathers copy, may goe to hell too by their fathers copy. <hi>Ierome</hi> once deſired leave of <hi>Auſtin</hi> to erre with ſeven fathers whom he found of his opinion, I ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that leave, nor envy any one the priviledge. The Fathers are but children, when they erre, and they who will erre with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are worſe then children.</p>

                     <p>Conſider then to what antiquity and to what fathers you appeal. Many practices are very old, yet very erroneous. Many old ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and old doings, muſt be unſaid and undone, or we ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever. How many old ſayings of the Jews doth Chriſt gain-ſay (Mat. 5.) <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid by them of old time,</hi> thus and thus, <hi>But I ſay unto you</hi> &amp;c. And (Mat. 19.) anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Queſtion about divorce, <hi>Moſes indeed for the hardneſſe of your hearts, ſuffered you to put away your wives, but from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it was not ſo.</hi> Beſides, ſome (like the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>) feign anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, they can put a gray beard upon a green head; and their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions will be found fennowed and mouldy with errour, not with age. As we muſt take heed of novelties ſo we muſt be cautious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout antiquities. Some antiquities of old men are no better <hi>than old wives fables</hi> of which the Apoſtle bids us beware; unlearned old wives fables are as authentick as many learned mens antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties pleaded for. To have an itch after novelties, and to dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on antiquities, are alike vain and dangerous. Old fables and young fancies are with me at the ſame rate, <hi>No man having drunke old wine</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.35.) <hi>ſtrait way cals for new, for he ſaith the old is better.</hi> Old is better then new, if it be as good as new. But any new truth is better then the oldeſt errour; and every er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the elder it is, the worſer it is.</p>
                     <p>Again <hi>Bildad</hi> adviſes <hi>Job</hi> to prepare himſelf to the ſearch of his fathers. Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We muſt not preſume to finde truth with eaſe, or to come ſleightly by it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prepare thy ſelf</hi> (Prov. 2.3.) <hi>If thou criest after knowledge, and lifteſt up thy voice for underſtanding: if thou dig for it as ſilver, and ſearch for it as for hid treaſures, then thou ſhalt finde,</hi> &amp;c. A man that will finde ſilver, muſt prepare and fit himſelf to ſearch for ſilver. That lies not upon the ſurface, but in the boſome and bowels of the earth. There are four things wherein this preparation conſiſts.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Humility: God doth not teach but reſiſt the proud, he gives more grace (humility is much grace) to the humble. A lowly minded man ſhall know the minde of the moſt high God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Holineſſe ſubmitting to and practiſing the truth we know prepares us for the receiving of more truth. He that doth the will of Chriſt ſhall know his doctrine, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.17.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Prayer: <hi>Doth any man want wiſdome, let him ask of God</hi> Jam. 1.5. Truth is the daughter of God, and he will not beſtow her
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51057:34"/> in marriage upon our mindes, unleſſe we ask him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Love unto truth. <hi>Truth is a beauty, and deſerves our love;</hi> to love truth is not a civility, but a duty: to ſearch for truth without love to truth, is a diſhonour to truth; and as the not receiving the love of the truth, is the cauſe why many apoſtatize and fall from it, ſo it is a reaſon why many are ſtill ignorant and cannot come at it. As God, the Father of truth muſt be askt his good will before we can have her: So truth the daughter of God ſhall be loved before we have her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bildad</hi> having thus adviſed <hi>Job</hi> to ſearch antiquity, giveth him a reaſon of his advice, a modeſt reaſon, reflecting upon himſelf and upon his friends.</p>

                     <p>There are three ſorts of ſhadows. 1. Naturall. 2. Civill. 3. Spirituall.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, A naturall ſhadow is a dark light cauſed by the comming of ſome thick body between us and the Sunne. This is a ſhadow in a proper and ſtrict acception.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Beſides the naturall, there is a civill ſhadow, <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is a ſhadow:</hi> and to be under a ſhadow, is to be protected. We tranſlate (<hi>Numb.</hi> 14, 9.) <hi>Their defence is departed from them,</hi> the Hebrew is, <hi>Their ſhadow,</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5. &amp; 25.4.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A ſhadow is taken for a dark or imperfect repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things ſpirituall; ſo all the Ceremonies of the old Law are called ſhadows (<hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. &amp; 10.1. &amp; 9.9. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17.) Ceremonial vvorſhip is expreſſed by a ſhadow, becauſe it was but an obſcure repreſentation of the truth: The Ceremonies were interpoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt the true light and us, and ſo caſt a ſhadow of him. Or, as a Painter, vvho is to draw the lively figure or ſhape of a man, at firſt makes an obſcure draught, or ſome imperfect lines of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but afterwards gives it beauty and luſtre to the life. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaicall rites were ſuch a ſhadow of heavenly things. Yet further, a ſhadow (vvhich comes neareſt the meaning of this text) notes the leaſt imaginable ſign or ſemblance of a thing: So (<hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17.) when the Apoſtle ſaith, That with God the Father of lights, <hi>there is not ſo much as a ſhadow of turning,</hi> he means, there is not the leaſt ſign or token of turning with God.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Bildad</hi> ſaith, <hi>Our daies upon earth are but as a ſhadow,</hi> vve may underſtand it, either of the time paſt, and ſo our life is but as
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51057:36"/> a ſhadow that is gone. Or, it may be meant of the whole life of man taken together. The life of man (take it from the beginning to the ending, from the <hi>Alpha</hi> to the <hi>Omega,</hi> from the firſt to the laſt of it) is a ſhadow. The compariſon is frequent in Scripture, I ſhall not need to ſtay upon it. See two or three particulars of the reſemblance.</p>

                     <q>Shall not they teach thee?</q>
                     <p>How, could they teach? They were dead and gone, they were paſt many ages before. <hi>Bildad</hi> may be conceived to anſwer, <hi>Though the fathers are dead, yet they will speak to thee, and counſell thee, as well as if they lived and ſtood before thee with our ſelves. They ſhall teach thee, and they ſhall inſtruct thee.</hi> And more then that, they will not onely teach thee in a complement, and ſpeak words to thee, but they will ſpeak their very hearts to thee: thou ſhalt finde that they will give thee cordial counſell, They will utter words to thee out of their heart.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tter words out of their heart.</q>
                     <p>The meaning of that is, either: Firſt in generall, they will give thee the reall conceptions of their mindes about theſe points, they will ſpeak ſincerely, they will not ſpeak to thee from the teeth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but from the heart inward. Secondly, they will ſpeak wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and judiciouſly to thee about theſe things; they will utter, not ſo much words as oracles to thee out of their heart.</p>

Chriſt aſſures us, <hi>That a good man out of the good treaſure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treaſure of his heart brings forth evil things.</hi> Every heart is a treaſury. When a good man ſpeaks evil, he ſpeaks not from his heart (though he hath a ſtock of ſinfulneſſe in him) but from his lips; and when an evil man ſpeaks good, he ſpeaks it not from his heart, but from his lips: for he hath no ſtock or treaſury of good within. An hypocrite ſpeaks good with a heart and a heart, with a double heart. A fool ſpeaks without a heart, yet of the two, it is better to have no heart then two.</p>
                     <p>Or we may take the meaning of the words, as a ſecret reproof of <hi>Job;</hi> If thou wilt look after theſe fathers, and ſearch them, they will not ſpeak as thou haſt done, raſhly, unadviſedly and indiſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but they will ſpeak from their hearts, they will utter things of weight and ſerious conſideration.

                        <hi>Abraham</hi> anſwers him, <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they be perſwaded though one roſe from the dead. They have Moſes and the Prophets;</hi> but <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were dead and gone; how have they <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets? they have not the men before them, but they had their writings and records: they who read the Prophets writings, hear their ſpeakings. <hi>Books are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent voices.</hi>

                     <p>If <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets may be heard when dead and gone, then much more may we hear Chriſt, ſince he died and roſe, and his Apoſtles who are dead. And whereas ſome have an opinion that they do not know the minde of Chriſt, or that they cannot reform the Church or their Churches till Chriſt himſelf come from heaven to do it, or till there be Apoſtles ſent perſonally to do it (they wanting an Apoſtle, cannot order the vvorſhip and ordinances of God, and therefore conclude againſt a preſent Church-ſtate) I ſay to ſuch, if that be your ground that you muſt have Chriſt and his Apoſtles to ſettle all for you; you have your deſires. Look into the vvorks and vvord of Chriſt, into the vvritings and practices of his Apoſtles, both for your rule and patern. If <hi>Abraham</hi> could ſay, they have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, they may hear them: ſurely, vve may ſay much more, we have Chriſt and his Apoſtles vvhom vve may hear and conſult about all the inſtitutions and orders that concern the frame of his Church. We need not ſtay till Chriſt come down in perſon from heaven, or till new Apoſtles are ſent, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed vvith inſtruction for this vvork, for we have Chriſt and his Apoſtles already, vve hear what Chriſt ſpake, vve read the rules vvhich he gave concerning the vvaies of his vvorſhip and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church (in all the eſſentiall and conſtitutive parts of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to the end of the world.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>You may ſee where the fathers, the holy men in ancient time laid up truth: they utter words out of their heart, then, truth was laied
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51057:38"/> up there. Truth is (as it vvere) the heart of God, and therefore we muſt put it into our hearts. <hi>David</hi> hid the Commandments of God in his heart: <hi>Mary</hi> laid up the words of Chriſt there. To have the word only ſwimming in our <hi>brains,</hi> is to as little purpoſe, as to have it only in our <hi>Note-books.</hi> To have truth only in our brains or in our books, will do us as little good as water in our ſhoes. It is a ſad thing to conſider how many thouſand Sermons are written al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt word for word in books, and ſcarce a letter of them written in the heart. The promiſe of the new Covenant is, that God <hi>will write his law in our hearts:</hi> Let not any reſt ſatisfied in having the word written in their books.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve further, <hi>Holy men of old did highly eſteem the word and truths of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may know the eſteem they had of theſe by the place where they laid theſe; the heart is the beſt place, the faireſt room in man. To put a thing into the heart, notes higheſt eſteem and approbation. When we ſay a thing is in our hearts we cannot ſay more to expreſſe our eſteem of it. When the Apoſtle (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.7.) profeſſes to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians, I have you in my heart;</hi> his meaning is, you are moſt dear and precious to me. When vve ſee a man preparing a ſpeciall place, a ſafe place, a convenient place to lay a thing in, we conclude that the thing he vvould lay up is of value and account vvith him: vvhen vve are preparing and fitting our hearts to put the vvord and truths of God in, hereby we give a real teſtimony, that we honour the word of God. For the moſt part the truths of God (as we ſay of things we neglect) are caſt at mens heels rather then laid up in their hearts. We may know the eſteem a Queen of <hi>England</hi> had of the City of <hi>Calice,</hi> when ſhe ſaid, <hi>It was in her heart, and there they ſhould finde it, if they opened her.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, As the ruſh dies, becauſe it hath no water; ſo an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite declines and waſtes, becauſe he is not watered by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God, and hath no rooting in grace. The <hi>ſeed caſt on the ſtony ground</hi> (Matth. 13.6.) <hi>withered, becauſe it had no earth.</hi>

                        </gap>he lack of earth to the one is the ſame with the lack of water to the other.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In the generall, that as a ruſh flouriſhes a while, but quickly withers; ſo the beſt eſtate of an hypocrite, his greenneſſe is of no long continuance; his ſeeming graces, like his joyes, are but for a moment. Hence obſerve,</p>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51057:40"/> when we behold the graſſe and flowers of the field, the flag, the ruſh in the water: we may not only put the Queſtion, <hi>What is man?</hi> but we may reſolve the Queſtion, what the man is: when we look upon the meaneſt creatures, we may ſee peeces of our ſelves, they are as we are in many conſiderations, and we as they; what is man? Man is as graſſe.

It is well obſerved by one of them, <hi>That God ſent us the book of nature, before he ſent the book of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi> The minde of God was written upon the things which he had made, before he made tables or books to write his minde in. The Fathers had many revelations from the beginning, but they had not Scripture from the beginning. Some conceive that <hi>Iſaac</hi> going out into the fields to meditate, meditated upon the text of the creature, and uſed to raiſe his heart by thoſe ſteps of earth to heavenly contemplations. It is ſaid of <hi>Solomon</hi> (1 King. 4.32, 33.) <hi>That he ſpake three thouſand Proverbs, and his ſongs were a thouſand and five, and that he spake of trees, from the Cedar tree that is in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

                        <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> expounds thus, <hi>Solomon</hi> applied his three thouſand parables or ſimilitudes unto thoſe trees or plants about which he diſcourſed, drawing ſome divine morall from every plant, whoſe nature as a Philoſopher he had deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>More diſtinctly for the ſpiritualizing of this ſimilitude, conſider wherein a wicked man or an hypocrite, is like unto a ruſh; the ruſh may be of good value to us, being thus improved.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The ruſh is a very ſpungy, hoven, hollow ſubſtance, it is not ſolid or cloſe-grain'd: An hypocrite hath no ſolidity, we call him a hollow-hearted man.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Hypocrites are well compared to a ruſh or a flag, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in windy weather they ſit which way ſoever the winde ſits. They take no ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> by a ſtorm, becauſe they yeeld to every turn: let the winde blow which way it will, the ruſh breaks neither bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy nor branch. Let things turn which way they will, hypocrites
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51057:41"/> can ſhift, and bend, and yeeld with them. And therefore when ſtorms ariſe, which pull down and deſtroy many goodly trees of Gods own planting, theſe ruſhes continue. Hypocrites keep their ſtanding, becauſe they never ſtand. A great man being asked how he kept his honour and preferment in ſo many changes of winde and weather, of times and Princes, anſwered, <hi>By being a willow, and not an Oak.</hi> He that can ſway, ſeldome breaks. Hypocrites in the Church and State, live by the ſame principles.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A bulruſh or a flag in time of a ſtorm hangs down the head, but when the ſtorm is over, it holds up the head, and ſtands upright again. This reſemblance between the hypocrite and a bulruſh is given by the Prophet (Iſa. 58.5.) <hi>Is this the faſt that I have choſen, a day for a man to afflict his ſoul? Is it to bow downe his head as a bulruſh, &amp;c?</hi> The bulruſh in a ſtorm ſeems to be humbled to the very ground, but in fair weather it is as high as ever. Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites in times of publike humiliation, hang down their heads, and ſeem to lay their mouths in the duſt, but when the day is paſt, they quickly forget their ſorrows, <hi>If I</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, Gal. 1.18.) <hi>build again the things which I have destroyed, I make my ſelf a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſour.</hi> Hypocrites are the worſt ſort of tranſgreſſours, for they ſeem to deſtroy their ſins one day, but they indeed build them again the next.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The ruſh and the flag grow only in miry places, where they may have abundance of water and moiſture, which notes a kinde of ſenſuality in them, and therefore they have their names from <hi>drinking.</hi> So hypocrites ſeem to be heavenly, but are indeed earthly: they are like the ruſh, they cannot live without ſtore of water, they are ſenſuall, they muſt pleaſe their appetites, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light their palates. The Apoſtle deſcribes them ſo, <hi>They ſerve not the Lord Jeſus, but their own bellies;</hi> they muſt be ſupported with the affluence of outward things, elſe they cannot hold out, in profeſſion. Whereas the godly and true believers can live, when the water is drain'd or dry'd away, when outward things fail and are gone. So the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> profeſſes, Chap. 3. ult. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſome, neither ſhall fruit be in the vines, though the fields ſhall yeeld no meat, and there be no herds in the ſtalls, yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, and will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi> A godly man will grow when all the world decaies to him; he will rejoyce in God when all outward comforts fail him; hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites muſt have ſenſuall ſupplies, or they are loſt. <hi>A feigned love
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51057:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> of spirituall things is ever joyned with a true love of worldly things.</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks of ſome who followed him more for the loaves then for the word. And <hi>Judas</hi> followed his Maſters bag, more then his Maſter.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Bulruſhes or flags yeeld no fruit at all, they only make a fair ſhew; hypocrites how green ſo ever they are, what ſhew or profeſſion ſoever they make, yeeld no fruit of holineſſe.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, A bulruſh or a flag withers ſooner then any other herb, that is, then other herbs that are not ſeated ſo near the water. And this agrees well with the hypocrite, for when the hypocrite begins once to wither, he withers quickly. He never had any true life, and he will not long appear to have any. When one that hath made a fair profeſſion begins to decay, he decaies ſooner than a meer civil man; a civil man will hold out in honeſty and juſtice a great while, but a hypocrite gives over holineſſe and godlineſſe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Beſides, God blaſts and withers an hypocrite ſooner than any other man, becauſe he hath abuſed and wronged God more then any other man. When judgements come they fall firſt upon hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, <hi>The hypocrites in Zion tremble,</hi> Iſa. 33. Trembling will take hold upon the prophane and openly wicked, but trembling takes hold fooneſt upon hypocrites; they have moſt cauſe to tremble, who were confident without a cauſe. Falſe hope is the parent of reall fear; and they who believe without repenting, ſhall repent without believing.</p>

                        </note> this is the way and the end of all thoſe who forget God.</p>
                     <p>The path of a man is taken two vvaies.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, For his ſtate and condition, Pſal. 1. <hi>The way of the wicked ſhall periſh;</hi> that is, the vvhole ſtate of a wicked man ſhall periſh.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, For his courſe and converſation, <hi>Job</hi> 33.11. <hi>He put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth my feet in the ſtocks, he marketh all my paths,</hi> that is, he takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the vvhole courſe of my life; all my converſation, all my tradings and dealings are before God. This path of mans courſe and converſation is two-fold. There is an internall, and there is an externall path. The internall is that of the minde; the minde hath it's courſe, the heart hath a vvay, Iſa. 57.17. <hi>He went on fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the way of his heart.</hi> The external path is that of outward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51057:42"/> That which we uſually doe, is our path. Thus the actions and works of God are called the paths of God, Job 40.19. <hi>Behe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth is the chief of the waies of God.</hi> Prov. 8.22. <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</hi> Pſal. 77.13. <hi>Thy way, O God, is in the ſanctuary;</hi> that is, thy actings and doings are ſeen there.</p>
                     <p>Our actions are compared to a path in two reſpects. 1. Becauſe we are frequent in them, that which is a mans courſe he treads e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day. 2. They are called our paths, becauſe they lead us to ſame end; every path leads us to ſome place or other. Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions lead to life, and ſome to death, ſome lead to heaven, ſome to hell, ſome to Chriſt, and ſome to Satan, to one of theſe ends, we are travelling and journeying all the daies of our lives.</p>
                     <q>Of thoſe that forget God.</q>
                     <p>To forget God imports theſe four things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Not to think of God, we forget that which we minde not. The firſt act of remembring is thinking. The thief on the croſſe prayed, <hi>Lord remember me when thou commeſt into thy Kingdom;</hi> that is, think of me for good. God is not in all the thoughts of a wicked man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o obey or honour him, and a wicked man is not in all the thought of God (in this ſenſe) to bleſſe or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To forget God, is to diſobey God, or not to doe the will of God, Deut. 8.11. <hi>Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God in not keeping his Commandments.</hi> As to remember God is to do the will of God, Eccleſ. 12.1. <hi>Remember thy Creatour in the daies of thy youth:</hi> that is do the will of thy Creatour in the daies of thy youth: ſo to forget God, is to diſobey God, not to doe his will. God is ſaid to forget us when he doth not our will, that is, when we in prayer propoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>fe to God to doe them for us, the not doing of thoſe things for us, into forget us. <hi>David</hi> expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Pſal. 77.9. <hi>Hath the Lord forgotten to be gracious?</hi> He had praied much at the beginning of the Pſalm with ſucceſſe, <hi>I cried unto God with my mouth, even unto God with my voice, and he gave ear unto me.</hi> He puts up other requeſts, which finding no preſent anſwer or ſenſible acceptance, he cries out, <hi>Hath the Lord forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be gracious?</hi> Now, as when the Lord doth not our will, he is ſaid in Scripture to forget us, ſo when we do not the will of God, we indeed forget him.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:51057:42"/>3. To forget is lightly to eſteem, to ſleight the Lord. That which a man highly eſteems, he keeps in his memory, and treaſure it up there; and when a man forgets a thing,<note place="margin">Oblivio affert contemptum.</note> eſpecially when he wilfully forgets it, he diſreſpects it, he ſleights and contemns it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.14. <hi>All thy lovers have forgotten thee;</hi> that is, thy lovers care not for thee, they ſleight and eſteem lightly of thee. When a man comes not at one, whom he loves, he is ſaid to forget him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.32. <hi>Can a maid forget her ornaments. or a bride her attire?</hi> A maid hath a great eſteem of her ornaments; eſpecially of her wedding ornaments, and therefore ſhe is often thinking of them; it may be ſhe can hardly ſleep the night before, for thinking of the rich gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yea the bracelets and bables ſhe is to wear upon the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding day. <hi>Can a bride forget her attire?</hi> Will ſhe throw theſe by the walls (as we ſpeak) or caſt them at her heels? Yet, ſaith the Lord, <hi>My people have forgotten me daies without number.</hi> They have lightly eſteemed me, I am not ſo much to them as new clothes, who am indeed their life; I am not ſo much remembred as unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary curioſities, from whom they receive all things neceſſary, and whoſe favour is the one thing neceſſary.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To forget God is to depart from God. We ſtay with God no longer then we remember him: as we cannot have communion with truth, ſo not with the God of truth, without an act of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory (Heb. 12.5.) <hi>Ye have forgotten the exhortation which ſpeaketh unto you as unto children, My ſon, despiſe not thou the chastening of the Lord</hi> &amp;c. A word forgotten is to us of no more uſe then a word never ſpoken. We are without all the good we forget; and to forget God is (Epheſ. 2.12.) <hi>to be without God in the world,</hi> or, to live on earth as if there were no God in heaven, either in regard of mercy to be received, or of duty to be performed. Hypocrites forget God all theſe waies; though their naturall memory may be good, yet ſpirituall memory (and that only holds ſpirituall things) they have none. Obſerve hence,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That the hypocrite is a forgotter of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Every wicked man is forgetfull of God. Hence we finde theſe put together, Pſal. 9.17. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and all the Nations that forget God:</hi> But this is the ſpeciall character of an hypocrite, he is a forgetter of God. Conſider this (ſaith the Pſalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt) ye that forget God; that is, ye hypocrites conſider this (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> 50.22) for he ſpeaks of ſuch as had taken their covenant of God in their mouths; <hi>What haſt thou to do</hi> (verſ. 16.) <hi>to take my Covenant
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51057:43"/> in thy mouth?</hi> As if he had ſaid, thou profeſſeſt to be in Covenant with me, to have an intereſt in me, <hi>Yet when thou ſawest a thief, then thou conſentest with him, and haſt been partaker with adulterers, thou giveſt thy mouth to evil,</hi> &amp;c. Hypocrites take the Covenant of God in their mouths, but caſt it out of their lives, <hi>God is near in their mouths, but from their reins</hi> (Jer. 12.2.) If the hypocrite did not forget, that God is about his bed, and about his path, and eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out all his waies, he could not be ſo falſe with God, ſo pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his waies, ſo rotten in his inward parts. If an hypocrite did not forget, that God being a ſpirit delighteth to be worſhipped in Spirit, he would never be ſatisfied in worſhipping him with his body. If he did not forget that God is jealous, that he will not hold them guiltleſſe who take his name in vain, he durſt not (which is his every daies work) take the name of God in vain.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, obſerve, <hi>That forgetfulneſſe of God</hi> (howſoever it ſeems no great matter, yet) <hi>is exceeding ſinfull, a wickedneſſe of the higheſt ſtature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Forgetfulneſſe of God is therefore a great wickedneſſe, becauſe God hath done ſo many things to be remembred by. What could the Lord have done more to make himſelf remembred then he hath done, <hi>Have I been a wilderneſſe to Iſrael, or a land of darkneſſe?</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.31.) the words are an aggravation of their forgetfulneſſe. As if the Lord had ſaid, I have been a light to you whereſoever you goe, and whereſoever I goe my ſteps drop fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for you, and am I forgotten? Where can we ſet a ſtep but we tread upon a remembrance of God? Every creature holds forth God unto us. He hath left his remembrance upon every ordinance, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt in that great ordinance of his Supper: yea all the works of his providence are remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of him. He leaves an impreſſion of his wiſdome, holineſſe, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, power upon all he doth. Now for us to forget God who hath (as it were) ſtudied ſo many waies to faſten himſelf in our remembrance, muſt needs be extreamly ſinfull. Further it is very ſinfull to forget God, becauſe God doth ſo abundantly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us. He hath not only done that which may cauſe man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him; but he hath man alwaies in his remembrance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his own people, <hi>He hath graven them upon the palms of his hands, and they are continually before him.</hi> They who deſire to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their friends freſh in memorie, get their pictures in their houſes, or engrave them upon rings and jewels which they wear
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51057:43"/> alwaies about them. But he that cuts the image of his friend in his fleſh, or draws it upon his skin, how zealous is he of his friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance? Pictures and annulets may be loſt, but our hands can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall off. When the Lord would ſhew how mindefull he is of his Church, he aſſures her that he carries her picture alwaies about him, not drawn upon a Tablet, or engraven upon the ſignet of his right hand, but upon the palms of his hands; as if he ſhould ſay, I muſt loſe my ſelf, before I can loſe the ſight of memory of thee (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.16.) He remembers her ſo, that he cannot forget her. And becauſe the characters and ſtamps of nature are more abiding and indelible then thoſe of art, therefore he ſaith (<hi>verſ.</hi> 15.) <hi>Can a woman for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her ſucking childe, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſonne of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will not I forget thee.</hi> A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may break the bonds of nature, but God will never break the bonds of his own free-grace. May not all this raiſe us into <hi>Davids</hi> rapture of holy admiration, Pſal. 8. <hi>Lord, what is man that thou art mindefull of him, and the ſonn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of man, that thou viſiteſt him</hi> with ſuch remembrances? What is a wicked man, that God ſhould give him bread to eat, and clothes to put on? And what is a godly man that God ſhould give him Chriſt to eat, and cloath himſelf withall? That, God ſhould remember us is a wonder of mercy; but what a wonder of unthankfulneſſe is it, that we ſhould not remember God? What, or <hi>who is God, that man ſhould be ſo mindeleſſe of him?</hi> Is not God worthy of all our remembrance? Is it loſſe of time to call God into our thoughts? Do we ever, or in any thing remember our ſelves ſo much, as when we remember God moſt? It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull favour that God ſhould be mindefull of us at all; and is it not a wonderfull ſinne, that man ſhould be ſo unmindefull of God?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Obſerve, That, <hi>Forgetfulneſſe of God is a mother-ſinne, or the cauſe of all other ſins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the cauſe of this ſinne of hypocriſie, <hi>Bildad</hi> puts it as a fruit of forgetting God. Forgetfulneſſe of God is three-fold.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, A forgetfulneſſe that there is a God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A forgetfulneſſe who, or what manner of God he is, <hi>Thou thoughteſt that I was ſuch an one as thy ſelf</hi> (Pſal. 50.) Thou forgetteſt what manner of God I am: thou preſumeſt that will ſerve my turn, which ſerves thine, or that every thing will pleaſe me which pleaſes thee: thou ſaieſt, becauſe it is no great trouble to thee to ſteal and lie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore it is no great trouble unto me neither.</p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:51057:44"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, To forget God, is to forget what God requires; this Forgetfulneſſe of theſe three ſorts is productive of any, of every ſin.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Obſerve, <hi>They that forget God ſhall quickly wither, how great and flouriſhing ſoever they are.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reaſon is this, becauſe the forgetting of God, is a departing from God, and he that departs from God departs from the fountain of life. If the ruſh go out of the water it quickly withers, and if men will depart from God, they ſhall quickly decay, neither grace nor comforts can hold out ſeparated from Chriſt. Why is the godly man <hi>compared to a tree planted by the river ſide, which brings forth fruit in his ſeaſon, whoſe leaf alſo ſhall not wither, and whatſoever he doth ſhall proſper?</hi> Why is the man that truſts in the Lord compared to a <hi>Tree planted by the waters, that spreads out her roots by the river, and ſhall not ſee when heat commeth?</hi> Jer. 17.7, 8. is it not becauſe the Saints alwaies keep cloſe to God, by Jeſus Chriſt, who is as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verliving fountain of water to them, refreſhing and moiſtening them ſo, with continuall ſupplies of the Spirit, that they <hi>ſhall not ſee when heat commeth?</hi> that is, they ſhall not be afflicted with thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil effects of heat, drought and barrenneſſe. They who keep Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, may poſſibly feel ſome decaies, but die they ſhall not, they ſhall revive and ſprout up again; They ſhall again put forth their leaves as a plant, and their fruit as the garden of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;</hi> They ſhall bring forth fruit in old age, they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing.</p>

The hypocrite hath a <hi>divided heart,</hi> Hoſ. 10.3. and a <hi>double minde,</hi> Jam. 1.8. He is not half enough for God, and too much for himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Hypocrites are of two ſorts, ſome in a large, others in a ſtrict ſenſe. Moſt wicked men are hypocrites in a large ſenſe, though ſome are above hypocriſie, they are arrived at impudence. The Prophet ſpeaks of ſuch (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.9.) <hi>The ſhew of their countenance doth witneſſe against them, and they declare their ſin as Sodome, they hide it not.</hi> They declare it not as the mourners in <hi>Zion</hi> declare their ſinne, who are aſhamed of it; but they declare it as <hi>Sodome</hi> her ſin, that they may delight in it. But though there are ſome ſuch as theſe, yet the greateſt number of wicked men fall under the notion of hypocriſie in a large ſenſe, becauſe they keep their ſins cloſe and hide them. Hence the works of ſinne are called works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Wicked men uſually hide their wickedneſſe, and ſhew that which hath but a ſhew, their goodneſſe. But in a ſtrict ſenſe, he is an hypocrite that ſeems to be very religious, who hath nothing but God, and Chriſt, and heaven in his mouth; but in his heart and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret practices nothing but earth and hell. The hypocrite is like the Onyx-ſtone, of which Naturaliſts write, that it is clear and bright in the ſuperficies, but the center is dark and earthy. This genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is pure, not only in their own eyes (<hi>Prov.</hi> 30.12.) but in the eyes of many men, poſſibly in the eyes of all men, <hi>yet are they not cleanſed from their wickedneſſe.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The hypocrites hope ſhall periſh.]</hi> That is, the time ſhall come when he ſhall give over the hope which he hath hoped, or the thing ſhall fail him, wherein he hoped. Firſt, the object of his hope ſhall fail him, that is, thoſe benefits, bleſſings, accommodations and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which he looked for in the profeſſion of religion, theſe ſhall fail him and prove falſe hopes.

                     <p n="2">2. Further, the word imports gradually, 1. diſpleaſing, 2. loathing or abominating, 3. chiding or contending.</p>
                     <p>The words yeelding theſe ſenſes, receive different tranſlations and interpretations.</p>
                     <p>Firſt thus, taking the former for <hi>inconſtancy or folly, his folly ſhall diſpleaſe him,</hi> or, <hi>His folly ſhall not pleaſe him:</hi> So the Vulgar, <hi>Hypocrites never pleaſe God, and at laſt they ſhall not pleaſe themſelves.</hi> The waies and works of hypocrites are ever diſpleaſing to God, and they ſhall at laſt be diſpleaſing to themſelves. Thats the ſenſe of their tranſlation.</p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:51057:46"/>
                     <p>And not only ſhall the waies of an hypocrite be diſpleaſing, but they ſhall be a loathing, an abhorring to him: the Lord loaths him now, <hi>The prayer of the wicked is an abomination,</hi> and he ſhall loath himſelf hereafter.<note place="margin">Haec displicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia cum faſtidio quodam &amp; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſcentia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncta eſt.</note> There is a double loathing. There is, a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of repentance. And there is, a loathing of deſpair. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (though it be unpleaſant, yet it) is an happy loathing of our ſelves. Such loathing of our ſelves is pleaſing to God in the act, and will be pleaſant to us in the fruit (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.9.) <hi>They ſhall loath themſelves for the evils they have committed.</hi> And again, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.47. and 20.43. the word is taken for this loathing of repentance. But the hypocrite ſhall have another kinde of loathing. What? a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of deſpair, ſeeing himſelf utterly loſt, and his hopes quite cut off, he ſhall be an abhorring to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>There is yet a third ſtep or degree of ſenſe in this word, He ſhall not only be diſpleaſed with himſelf, and loath himſelf, but he ſhall fall out with himſelf; his hope ſhall diſpleaſe or vex him, into ſelf-anger.<note place="margin">Secum ipſe liti gabit, rixabitur, quae omnia ad mentis commo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tionem &amp; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi cruciatum pertinent. <hi>Pin.</hi>
                        </note> Some render the word by contending or chiding: as a man that is diſpleaſed with another, falleth out with him, wrangleth and contendeth with him; ſo an hypocrite, at laſt ſhall chide, contend and wrangle with himſelf: he ſhall contend as much with himſelf at laſt, as ever the word of God contended with him before. An hypocrite never commeth to a Sermon, but God chides him, the Word of God contends with him, and the Spirit of God hath a controverſie with him; this man will not be warned by the chiding of God, nor take that to heart, he ſtill goes on in his hypocriſie. But when no reproofs nor chidings can prevail upon his heart, he is left to the reproofs and chidings of his own heart: which will read him ſuch a lecture, and give him ſuch a ſchooling as he never had in all his life. Conſcience may be long ſilent, and it may long flatter, but when once it begins to ſpeak, and to ſpeak right, it is the moſt terrible Preacher in the world. There is no <hi>Boanerges</hi> or ſonne of thunder hath ſo dreadfull a voice. Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> it ſelf did not thunder ſo loud as conſcience will. And as conſcience ſpeaks loud, ſo it ſpeaks long. An hypocrite ſhall reprove and chide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for ever; What a fool was I? What a beaſt was I thus to flatter my ſelf, thus to mask mine own filthineſſe, and to dawb over the rottenneſſe of my heart with the fair covering of a verball pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion? Why did I wilfully deceive my ſelf into irrecoverable perdition?</p>
                     <p>Again, Obſerve from, <hi>Whoſe folly ſhall displeaſe him.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Of all fools the hypocrite is the greateſt; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he takes a great deal of pains in profeſſion, and hath no good at all by profeſſion: he ventureth himſelf many times in the world to perſecution; he runs the hazard of his credit, of his eſtate, of liberty and life. What a fool is this to take ſo much pains, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject himſelf to ſo many dangers in the outward profeſſion of Chriſt, yet at laſt to loſe the fruit and benefit of all? <hi>This folly muſt needs displeaſe him:</hi> he ſhall at laſt ſee what an extreme fool he hath been, to trouble himſelf about that which bringeth him in no reall good, but will really double and encreaſe all evil upon him. <hi>No man ſins at ſo dear a rate as the hypocrite.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A ſecond tranſlation takes the <hi>Noun</hi> (as we) for hope, and not for folly, and retains the former ſenſe of the <hi>Verb;</hi> and ſo the words are thus, <hi>Whoſe hope ſhall loath him;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Quem faſtidit spes ſua <hi>Jun.</hi> Eum quaſi fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtidius fugit id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſum quod ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. <hi>Jun.</hi>
                        </note> The thing which he hoped for ſhall loath him; how loath him? It ſhall loath him, not formally, but equivalently, becauſe it ſhall doe that which man doth, when he loaths any thing; when we loath a thing, we flee or turn away from it; ſo, <hi>His hope ſhall hath him,</hi> that is, the thing which he hoped for ſhall flee farre away, and quite depart, it will not come near him. Good ſhall remove from the hypocrite when he expects and makes after it. An hypocrite at once loaths true grace, and hopes for true comforts: but comfort here and glory hereafter ſhall loath him, heaven ſhall ſhut againſt him.</p>
                     <p>Or take it for the act of hope (as others) <hi>he ſhall loath his hope;</hi>

                        </note> that is, the very hope which he hath had ſhall be grievous and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to him; nothing ſhall grieve him more then this, that he hath hoped ſo much. His hope ſhall grieve and afflict him as bad as all his afflictions; <hi>Raiſed expectations diſappointed, prove our greateſt ſorrows.</hi> That man ſinks loweſt in grief, whoſe heart was higheſt in hope.

                        </note> The word is rendred, <hi>Cut off,</hi> by a Metaphor, becauſe when a man is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51057:47"/> exceedingly diſpleaſed and vexed (as the word properly ſignifies) he many times tears his garments, and even cuts his own fleſh, like the idolatrous Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> who were ſo angry, becauſe they could not get an anſwer, that <hi>they cut themſelves after their manner with knives and lancers, till the blood guſhed out upon them,</hi> 1 King. 18.28. <hi>Grief cuts the heart alwaies, and ſometime cauſes cutting of the fleſh.</hi> The Lord complains (Pſal. 95.10.) <hi>Fourty years long was I grieved with this generation,</hi> it is this word, <hi>fourty years long was I vexed and cut with this generation,</hi> with their murmurings, backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and unbelief. They did (as it were) cut the Lord to the heart; as in another place, <hi>They broke him with their whoriſh hearts,</hi> Eze. 6.9. God ſpeaks there as a man, whoſe patience is almoſt ſpent, or, as an husband grieved with the diſloialties of an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wife.</p>
                     <p>And thus we may joyn it with hope, either as hope imports the act of hope, or the object of hope, <hi>Whoſe hope ſhall be cut off;</hi> the expectation which the hypocrite hath had ſhall come to an end. Or, a time is at hand when an hypocrite ſhall be paſt hoping. Obſerve hence,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Deſpairing is the cutting off of hope,</hi> and ſuch is the condition of an hypocrite. To have hope cut off, is the greateſt cut in the world. <hi>Will the hypocrite pray alwaies?</hi> No, at laſt his prayer ſhall be cut off; <hi>Will the hypocrite hope alwaies?</hi> No, at laſt his hope ſhall be cut off. The Saints in heaven have (in a ſenſe) their hope cut off, becauſe they are above hope: and at laſt all wicked mens hope ſhall be cut off, becauſe they are below hope. It is better to have all our poſſeſſions cut off, then our hopes. Better have the threed of our lives cut off, then the Anchor-cord of our hope cut off, and ſo we left to the rage and tempeſt of deſpair.</p>
                     <p>Again, joyn it with the object of hope, thus,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All that an hypocrite hopeth for or expects, ſhall be utterly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and cut off from him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His worldly comfort will be gone, and heavenly comforts will never come. He ſhall finde that he hath been in a golden dream, that he hath been, as one that is hungry, who dreameth that he is eating, but when he awakes his ſoul is empty; or, as a thirſty man, that dreams he is drinking, but he awakes, and behold, <hi>he is faint,</hi> Iſa. 29.8. <hi>When dreams ſatisfie hunger and thirst, the hypocrites hope ſhall be ſatisfied.</hi> Hypocrites ſhall have as good as they bring. They bring God nothing but words and empty profeſſions; and they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51057:47"/> ſhall have nothing from God, but air and empty expectations; their reall hopes, or the thing they hoped for ſhall be cut off. When hypocrites awake out of their ſleep, their hopes vaniſh as a dream. Not only doth the world, but the Chriſt on whom they hoped, prove a ſhadow, a fancy, an image, an idoll of their own making; Their hearts were filled with leaves, inſtead of gold, as the devil coſens his greedy votaries, <hi>Their hope ſhall be cut off.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>And whoſe truſt ſhall be a spiders web.</q>
                     <p>As hope before, ſo here truſt, may be put either for the act or object of truſt: and both (by a Synecdoche) for the whole profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an hypocrite.</p>
                     <p>Hope and truſt are often taken promiſcuouſly. There is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall difference between them, not an eſſentiall. Truſt being the ſtrength of hope, or the acting of a ſtrong faith.<note place="margin">

                        </note> The originall word ſignifies a very quiet, ſecure, ſetled truſt; when a man truſts upon, or about a thing, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>thout caſting ſo much as a jealous thought after it. Thus the hypocrite truſts; he never ſuſpects himſelf; his heart ſaith all is well, Levit. 25.18. <hi>Ye ſhall dwell in the land in ſafety;</hi> the word is, <hi>Ye ſhall dwell in the land in truſt,</hi> becauſe an opinion of ſafety is the companion of truſt; when we truſt our condition is good, then we think our ſelves ſafe.</p>
                     <p>There are two things noted by this word:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Boldneſſe and confidence.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Security and peaceableneſſe. The hypocrite feels no trouble, and he fears none; The language of his heart is like that of <hi>Babylon</hi> the mother of whoredoms and <hi>hypocriſie, who ſaith in her heart, I ſit a Queen, and am no widow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow,</hi> Revel. 18.6.</p>
                     <p>This truſt where it is true hath a double effect. The want of which diſcovers the falſeneſſe of it in the hypocrite.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It confirms and ſtrengthens the heart againſt all oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It encourages the heart againſt all dangers. He that truſts in God will walk thorow the valley of the ſhadow of death, and fear no evil. He dares take a bear by the tooth, or a lion by the beard. In both theſe the truſt of the hypocrite faileth. He will work and go on boldly till he meets with oppoſition: he will work in a fair day, till he meets with a ſtorm, and dangers threaten; but there he gives over. <hi>He that is not acquainted with the aſſurance of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51057:48"/> of heaven, will ſeldome, if at all runne hazards here on earth.</hi> True truſt brings God and the ſoul together, but the hypocrite never comes near God: and then no marvell if he be afraid to come near danger.</p>
                     <p>Note from it, before we put the words together, thus much,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That an hypocrite hath a trust of his own, a truſt like himſelf.</hi>

Have they zeal? ſo hath he; yea, the zeal of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie burns hotter for a blaſt, then the zeal of ſincerity. He hath grace proper to his ſtate; falſe grace for his falſe heart; he hath truſt, ſuch as it is, a truſt which belongeth to all of his rank; ſee the character of it in the next words.</p>

There is a kinde of curioſity in them, but there is no ſtrength or ſtability in them. The ſpider works very curiouſly, but her houſe will not bear any ſtreſſe of weather, much leſſe force of battery. The ſpiders web is no match for a broom or a whisk. Thus it is with the profeſſion, the truſt of hypocrites; you may ſee a neat ſpinning, a fine threed of profeſſion, accurate weavings and contrivances, but when it comes to a puſh, it is not able to ſtand; if you doe but touch it, 'tis gone. Some will ſtand out longer then others, yet all fall, as Chriſt aſſures us (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi>) it is the hypocrite who buildeth his houſe upon the ſand; to have a houſe built upon the ſand, is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then to have a houſe built in the cicling; when the ſtorm comes that houſe fals; and when the broom comes, this muſt down.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The truſt of an hypocrite is called a ſpiders web, becauſe he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51057:48"/> fetches and frames it (as it were) out of his own bowels: that whereunto he truſteth is wrought out of himſelf. That's the nature of the ſpider, ſhe hath no extrinſecall materials to build her houſe with; ſhe doth not hew her ſtones out of any quarry, or fetch her timber from any foreſt (as we may allude) the materials which ſhe hath ſhe fetcheth out of her own bowels. The Bee makes an houſe, and fetcheth the materials from this and that flower: ſo the Bee makes a comb for a houſe: but the ſpider ſucks no flowers. Thus it is with hypocrites, their truſt and hope is as the ſpiders web, made out of their own ſubſtance; they eviſcerate themſelves, they fetch all out of themſelves. The meaning is, all their truſt is in their own duties, in their own ſtrength, in their own ſtock, in their own gifts, upon theſe they build, theſe are their houſe. We finde the Phariſees truſt thus grounded, ſuch was his houſe (<hi>Luk.</hi> 18.) <hi>I faſt twice a week, I give alms, I pay all men their due.</hi> He was very exact in righteouſneſſe according to the Law, upon this, and out of this he makes his houſe; this is to make an houſe like a ſpider. <hi>Though it be our graces we truſt upon, our truſt will be a spiders web.</hi> The believer is well compared to a Bee, the Bee hath an houſe and honey, but the Bee fetcheth all from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, from herbs and flowers: Believers have their houſe to dwell in, and their honey to feed upon, but they ſuch all from the promiſes of Chriſt; yea, they ſuck it from Chriſt himſelf, they reſt not in the letter of the promiſes, but they go to Chriſt who is the matter promiſed, and the accompliſher of all the promiſes. Here they build their houſe, and hew out the pillars of it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Their truſt ſhall be a ſpiders web,</hi> in the iſſue it ſhall periſh like a ſpiders web. How is that? Aſſoon as the houſe comes to be cleanſed, down go the ſpiders webs; when the houſe is ſwept, the cob-webs are firſt ſwept away. Thus it is with the truſt of all hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites: when God ſweeps his houſe, his Church, he quickly ſweeps out theſe ſpiders webs (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.23.) the Prophet ſpeaks of <hi>the beſome of God;</hi> the judgements of God are the beſome of God, by which he ſweepeth his houſe. God hath a double beſome, or a double uſe of his beſome; he hath a beſome of deſtruction, and a beſome of purgation. It is a beſome of deſtruction to hypocrites, and it is a beſome of purgation to his Saints. When either the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of deſtruction, or the beſome of purgation is in hand, the truſt of hypocrites is ſwept away. When the Prophet deſcribes the Lord in his great and terrible judgements (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14.) the text
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51057:49"/> ſaith, <hi>The ſinners in Zion are afraid, fearfulneſſe ſurprizeth the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, who ſhall dwell with devouring fire?</hi> God provoked is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire. How ſhall ſtubble and ſpiders webs ſtand before him? When trouble comes, the truſt of hypocrites goes to wrack, they tremble then, for their truſt is but a ſpiders web, it cannot ſtand one ſtroak, or endure the flaming heat. The hope of a godly man grows ſtrongeſt in times of trouble, he is purified in the fire; and the hope of an hypocrite weakens, till it be none at all in times of trouble, it is caſt out of doors amongſt the rubbiſh, or is conſumed with the fire.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Take this parallel between the ſpiders web, and the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hypocrites. The ſpider makes his web to catch and enſnare others, to catch the poor flies. She hath a double uſe of her houſe, to lie in it, and to entrap flies in it. Her houſe is a ſnare. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of an hypocrite is a ſpiders web in this notion; he makes it to catch flies with, to enſnare and deceive the ſimple, that he may prey upon them: He would count godlineſſe a poor thing, did he not make a gain of godlines; That brings him in food and cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he lives upon it. This his deceitfull web is ſo fine ſpun, and fairly woven that you cannot eaſily diſcern any thing, but truth and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it: Hypocrites cannot be diſtinguiſht by the out-ſide of what they do; their lewdneſſe is under a cover. Some tell us that the Hebrew word for an hypocrite, may be derived from another, which ſignifies a cloud;<note place="margin">Nebulo, à neb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It noteth leaning upon a ſtaff, or upon any ſtay (1 Sam. 1.6.) <hi>Saul leaned upon his spear being weary in the battell.</hi> And, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Lean not to thine own understanding.</hi> Wiſe men, men of deep reach and judgement, lean to their own underſtandings, their wits are their props (Iſa. 10.20.) <hi>The remnant of Iſrael ſhall no more ſtay themſelves upon him that ſmote them but they ſhall ſtay upon the Lord,</hi> or, <hi>they ſhall lean upon the Lord, the holy One of Iſrael in truth.</hi> (2 Sam. 22.19.) <hi>they prevented me in the day of my calamity, but the Lord was my ſtay.</hi> God prevents his people with mercy, and their enemies prevent them with unkindeneſſes, but the love of God out-runs the malice of man; His love ſtaies up thoſe whom malice would caſt down.

                        </note> Bread is elegantly called a ſtaff, becauſe bread ſupports the life of man, as a ſtaff doth the body.

As an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry man leans upon his bread, ſo an hypocrite leans upon his houſe, <hi>He ſhall lean upon his houſe.</hi> That's his ſtay.</p>

                     <p>The houſe of this hypocrite it is two-fold; or he hath two hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. He hath a worldly houſe, and he hath a ſpirituall houſe. He hath one houſe made out of earthly materials; and another made out of heavenly materials.</p>

                        </note>He hath an houſe made out of worldly materials, and ſo ſome interpret this place, <hi>He ſhall lean upon his houſe;</hi> that is, upon his riches, upon his relations, upon his greatneſſe, upon his friends, upon his correſpondencies, upon the eſtimation that he hath abroad in the world, upon his reputation with his neighbours at home.</p>
                     <p>Theſe framed and put together are a houſe which the hypocrite builds for himſelf, upon theſe he reſts: and that's a truth, the world is an hypocrites ſupport, the houſe upon which he leans. The money in his cheſt upholds him, not faith in his heart; his goods pleaſe him more then goodneſſe. He eaſily believes that he is in the favour of God, becauſe he hath ſo much favour among men. That's one houſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bildad</hi> might aim at this, becauſe <hi>Job</hi> was a man of a full and vaſt eſtate, the richeſt and greateſt of all the men in the Eaſt; as if he had ſaid, <hi>Job, thou haſt leaned upon thy outward abundance, upon thy ſheep and oxen, upon thy children and ſervants, and now thou findeſt all but a spiders web, ſwept away in a moment.</hi> Yet (I conceive) he means rather a houſe built of heavenly materials. And there are three ſorts of heavenly materials, out of which the hypocrite builds his houſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Gifts: he hath knowledge and underſtanding in the word and waies of God, the gift of prayer, the gift (it may be) of tongues, of prophecy and preaching. Theſe are excellent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and upon theſe he builds his truſt, that he is in a good eſtate.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſort of materials, are holy duties, he praies, he hears, he faſteth, and he gives alms, and the like; Theſe he doth, and out of theſe materials he builds his houſe, very ſtrongly he hopes.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, He hath finer ſtuff then all this to build his houſe of, he buildeth upon ſuppoſed graces; he can tell you, he hath faith, he hath love, he hath patience, he hath humility, and he hath ſorrow for ſinne; he can count all theſe things, and out of theſe he build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf an houſe of ſpeciall confidence, ſuch a houſe as he doubts not will ſtand all windes and weathers: he hopes to ſtand ſafe in judgement, under the roof and goodly fabrick of this houſe.</p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:51057:50"/>
                     <p>Out of theſe three ſorts of materials, ſpirituall gifts, ſpirituall duties, and ſuppoſed ſpirituall graces; upon all theſe, and out of theſe he buildeth, and thinks he hath made an houſe that ſhall ſtand for ever.</p>
                     <p>The point I ſhall give you, taking in thoſe three ſorts of materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That gifts, duties and ſuppoſed graces are the ſtay and the ſtaff, the houſe, and the ſtrength of hypocrites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon theſe they lean, and in theſe they ſecure themſelves; they reſt upon this bottom for eternity. Hence they even dare to plead with God himſelf about it (Mat. 7.22.) <hi>Many will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy Name, and in thy Name caſt out devils, and done many great wonders?</hi> They tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted upon, <hi>Have we not propheſied? Have we not praied? Have we not done wonders?</hi> They thought thoſe ſufficient materials to build them a tower which ſhould reach heaven it ſelf; who can doubt but they who do ſuch things as theſe ſhall do well? The gift of prophecy, the power to caſt out devils, and work miracles, ſound high, and make a great noiſe. Yet at laſt, this tower of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence proves but a Caſtle in the air, or a ſpiders web. How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident were they who could plead thus with God: He hath opened the ſecrets of heaven to us, and do you thinke he will ſhut the gates of heaven upon us? We have preached, we have been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſaving others, and ſhall not we be ſaved ourſelves? We have caſt out devils, and ſhall we be caſt to the devil? We have not walked in an ordinary tract of Profeſſion, but we have traded in wonders and done miracles, we have amazed the world with reports of the great things we have done, is all this nothing? Thus they plead with Chriſt, as if he were bound to ſave them by the law of theſe ſervices: yet Chriſt tels them, <hi>Depart from me.

So Prayer is fleſh, ordinances are fleſh, the righteouſneſſe of the Law is fleſh; yea, <hi>Grace it ſelf truſted to is fleſh.</hi> The duties which Chriſt hath appointed are the houſe of the hypocrite: but Chriſt himſelf is the houſe of the upright; He would be <hi>found in him,</hi> (Phil. 3.9.) not in duties or inherent graces. Saints deſire that much grace may be found in them; but they dare not be found in graces; they would ever be acting graces, but never thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An hypocrites hope is high and ſtrong, that his estate is good now, and that he ſhall receive good at the laſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He leaneth upon this houſe. Some are without hope in the world, of whom we may ſpeak as the Apoſtle of an heretike (<hi>Tit.</hi> 3.11.) <hi>they are condemned of themſelves.</hi> Some men have the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condemnation in their own hearts. But there are others, as you ſee here, who have great and ſtrong confidences in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who live and die with this confidence too; This they do upon the former witneſſe. As the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks concerning the witneſſe which the Saints have for heaven, <hi>There are three which bear witneſſe</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and theſe three are one:</hi> So there are three which bear witneſſe to the hypocrite, and theſe three are one; they agree in one to deceive, as the other to give aſſurance.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The world that giveth many a man a witneſſe and letters teſtimoniall, that his eſtate is good, his neighbours ſay ſo, they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him and cry peace peace to him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Satan applauds him, the devil gives him his good word, and tels him that certainly his eſtate is very good.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, His own heart will ſeal to all, he ſhall have <hi>the witneſſe in himſelf,</hi> as it is ſpoken of the true believer. So that the hypocrite having ſuch witneſſes, a witneſſe within himſelf, a certificate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51057:51"/> the hand of Satan, and letters commendatory from the world, all this muſt needs give him ſtrength of hope, that his houſe ſhall ſtand for ever.</p>
                     <p>But ſee the iſſue, <hi>He leaneth upon his houſe,</hi> What then?</p>
                     <q>It ſhall not ſtand.</q>

He thought that the materials which he had brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the hopes which he had raiſed upon them, would have been as Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> that cannot be removed, but he leaneth upon it, <hi>and it ſhall not ſtand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whence obſerve, <hi>All that an hypocrite truſteth unto ſhall deceive him at the laſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It ſhall not ſtand.</hi> Their webs ſhall not become garments, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall they cover themſelves with their works,</hi> Iſa. 59.6. The lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is proverbiall, importing higheſt diſappointment: Who would weave a web, if he knew he ſhould never have a garment by it? Or work hard, when himſelf muſt go naked? <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.1, 2. the Lord ſends to the people by his Prophet, <hi>Say to this people, Truſt not to lying words;</hi> that is, words which will deceive and fail you, you truſt and lean to them, but they will fall away from you: What were thoſe words? Even that they had a goodly houſe to lean to, they cried, <hi>The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord:</hi> but I hope that's a ſtrong houſe, as well as a beautifull, a man may lean upon that, upon the temple of the Lord, and do well. No, <hi>The temple of the Lord leaned upon will be but a ſpiders web;</hi> God gave the Jews a temple to worſhip him in, and many of them worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the temple. We adore every duty we depend upon, and give the Ordinances of God the honour of God. We can ſtand no more by ſuch truſt to Ordinances, then we ſhall by the neglect of them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe, and all the materials before mentioned, will be found too weak, they ſhall not ſtand. Gifts cannot commend to God. If a man had the tongue of men and angels, if all the knowledge that ever was ſcattered in the world were brought together into one head; this cannot commend him unto God. The devil is as full of knowledge as he can hold, and yet he is as full of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as he can hold. Duties cannot commend to God.</p>
                     <p>And there are two ſpeciall reaſons why the hypocrites duties cannot.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, He is not at all changed in duties. He praies and ſins, hears and ſins, profeſſes and continues wicked cloſely, if not openly.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He leans upon his duties. Could we ſuppoſe true grace leaned on, that could not ſtand. <hi>Nothing is a ſufficient ſtrength for us to ſtay upon, but the free grace of God, and Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Lean to theſe houſes, for they will ſtand for ever.

The ſame will be ſaid of all the gifts, and duties and graces, which we ſtand upon. God hath given them us, and he hath given them us as meet helpers, but they will deceive and ruine us, if we lean on them. We ſhall fall by them, if we hope to ſtand by them (Pſal. 23.4.) <hi>Thou art with me in trouble</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) therefore I ſhall not fall;</hi> it is this word, <hi>Thou ſtandest with me.</hi> Chriſt will ſtand by us at all times, <hi>Thou ſtandeſt with me,</hi> or <hi>by me:</hi> When the world faileth, and when gifts fail, and when duties fail, yea, when gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fail, in degree and activity, then Jeſus Chriſt, and free grace will ſtand by us, Iſa. 26.7. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe minde is ſtaied on thee.

                        </note> So the word is tranſlated (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.8.) <hi>And the Lord God planted a paradiſe, or a garden of delight.</hi> The hypocrites garden is all that by which he preſerves and keeps his worldly comforts, as we do plants and flowers of profit or delight in gardens. Thus the hypocrite grows as a goodly tree, and ſhooteth forth his branches.</p>
                     <p>This is the firſt part of the deſcription of his flouriſhing eſtate. Hence note a point or two.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In generall (which hath heretofore been obſerved, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall but touch it.) <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That a wicked man, an hypocrite may abound exceedingly in outward proſperity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is a tree, green before the Sun, and ſhooting forth his branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in his garden.</p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:51057:55"/>
                     <p>Secondly, Note, <hi>That the thriving of hypocrites, their greenneſſe and flouriſhing, is only outward.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The tree is green before the Sunne, but he is withered in his ſoul. Hypocrites do all before the Sunne, to be ſeen, or in the ſight of men. They are of thoſe who rebell againſt the light, which would keep them from ſinne, and they ſay, <hi>No eye ſees us,</hi> while they are ſinning. But they love the light which ſhews any good they doe; then they ſay, O that all eyes did ſee us. Phariſees pray in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and blow a trumpet when they give alms, that the ears of all, as well as the bellies of the poor, may be filled with their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. <hi>Come, ſee my zeal,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jehu. Moſes</hi> was faithfull, but he never ſaid, Come, ſee my fidelity. <hi>Joſhua</hi> was valiant in the battles of the Lord, yet he never ſaid, Come, ſee my fortitude. The up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right heart cares not to be thus before the Sunne: He delights in ſecret holineſſe. His goodneſſe is not leſſe priz'd, or leſſe pleaſing to him, becauſe it is hidden. He takes infinitely more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in being and doing good, then in being known to be or doe good.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Taking, <hi>before the Sunne,</hi> to note the extreme heat of the Sun, we may obſerve thus much from it,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That an hypocrite may endure trouble and perſecution for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is not like the ruſh which preſently withereth, but he is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times like a tree that ſtandeth it out before the Sunne a great while. We know that many have not only performed outward acts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, but they have ſometimes ſuffered in a holy cauſe; they can be paſſive in obedience, as well as active, and yet have fallen away at the laſt. Before the Sun of proſperity the hypocrite will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue green very long; and before the Sunne of perſecution he may continue green a while. It is conceived by moſt that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copperſmith, ſpoken of by <hi>Paul</hi> (2 Tim. 4.14.) as a man very grievous to him, <hi>Alexander the Copperſmith did me much evil,</hi> He oppoſed the Apoſtle, yet, I ſay, this <hi>Alexander</hi> is conceived to be the man of whom we read (<hi>Act.</hi> 19.32.) that ſtood to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was in that danger at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> there he had like to have loſt his life for appearing on his ſide, the text ſaith, <hi>They dragged him out of the multitude to the market place.</hi> It is poſſible for an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite to be green before the Sunne of perſecution, at leaſt before ſome ſcorching beams of that Sun, though he is not able to bear it, when it comes to the utmoſt triall, to the extreme heat of the day.</p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:51057:56"/>
                     <p>Thus we ſee the hypocrites greenneſſe in his branches, yet that is not all, for in the next verſe we finde his roots alſo, he is ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſetled below, as well as beautifull above. And when a tree hath flouriſhing branches, and firm roots, what can be deſired more? For, as when a tree is cut down root and branch, it is then utterly taken away; ſo when a tree flouriſheth, root and branch, it is in beſt eſtate, and higheſt perfection. Both theſe meet here, not only doth he ſhoot forth his branches in his garden, <hi>But he wrappeth his roots about the heap, and ſeeth the place of ſtones.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, we may carry on the ſimilitude thus, <hi>If he deſtroy him,</hi> that is, if the Gardener or the Husbandman; if the Maſter or owner of that ground or place, ſeeing a tree thus luxuriant, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo near the foundation of his houſe, and ſo wrapped about the place of ſtones, hindering the light, darkning the windows of his houſe; if he come to deſtroy or cut him down, it ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him.</p>

                     <p>Then the meaning is, Though the tree be in this ſtate, yet if the husbandman come, he can quickly deſtroy it from his place: Yea, though it be thus fairly grown, and firmly rooted, the Sunne is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to kill this tree, and to draw out all it's moiſture, and ſo leave it dry and feared, fit only to be ſtubbed up for fewell.

                     <p>Even in the time of his greenneſſe, he ſhall be deſtroyed, and when his roots are wrapped about the heap. Trees ſtand ſo long ſometimes, that they wither of themſelves, and then we cut them

                     <p>That of <hi>Job (Chap.</hi> 20.22.) is full to this point, <hi>In the fulneſſe of his ſufficiency he ſhall be in straits:</hi> A ſtrange thing that a man ſhould be in ſtraits, when he is in his greateſt enlargement, that a man ſhould be emptied when he is full, that a man ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when he hath all ſufficiency about him, yet thus it ſhall be, <hi>In the fulneſſe of his ſufficiency he ſhall be in ſtraits.</hi> As a godly man hath a ſufficiency in his wants, yea a fulneſſe of ſufficiency in his wants: So on the other ſide, an hypocrite, whoſe heart is falſe with God, hath want in his ſufficiency, yea want in the fulneſſe of his ſufficiency. Which may be underſtood two waies; either that his fulneſſe in the greateſt ſufficiency of it is unſatisfying; or that his fulneſſe in the greateſt ſufficiency of it, is upon decaying and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating. (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.13.) <hi>Whileſt the meat was in their mouths, the wrath of God fell upon them;</hi> while meat is in the mouth, rich clothes upon the back, while ſtore of money is in the purſe, while the land brings forth abundance of encreaſe, even in all theſe ſufficiencies a man may be in ſtraits.

There is ſuch a meaning here, this green tree. This hypocrite ſhall have his branches ſo pull'd off, his roots ſo ſtubbed up, that it will be hard to give an account what's become of him.</p>
                     <p>We finde the happy and flouriſhing eſtate of the Church and people of God deſcribed, as if no place were large enough for them to dwell in (<hi>Zech.</hi> 10.10.) <hi>I will bring them again out of the land of Aegypt, and gather them out of Aſſyria,</hi> &amp;c. that is, I will gather my Saints, my Church together from all the parts of the world where they have lived (while they could not live, but ſculk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in corners) I will bring them together, ſo conſpicuouſly, <hi>that there ſhall be no place found for them;</hi> that is, no place capacious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to receive them and their families. We have the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of enlargement (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.) <hi>They ſhall ſay, The place is too ſtrait for me, give place to me that I may dwell.</hi> Now, as the Saints ſhall be gathered together ſo eminently and abundantly, that no place ſhall be found big enough to hold them; ſo the hypocrite with all his greenneſſe and verdure ſhall be ſo blaſted and rooted up, that the place where he was ſhall not be viſible, as his; he ſhall be ſo farre from filling all places, that he ſhall fill none, <hi>The place where he dwelt ſhall ſpue him out, and by any remaining ſymptome it ſhall not be known, where that man was.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So then, the ſumme of all may be given thus, taking the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon from the tree to this wicked man;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That as a tree highly grown and deeply rooted, may be ſo cut down and ſtubbed up, that it ſhall not be known whether ever it grew upon that place or no; ſo a wicked man though for a while he flouriſheth and overcommeth all impediments that hinder him, in the eye of the world, yet at laſt himſelf and his family ſhall be ſo clean removed and ſwept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, his name and memory ſo blotted out, that there ſhall not be any print or foot-ſtep of his being upon the face of the earth.</hi>

                        </note> It is an alluſion to dogs or ſpaniels, who (you know) when their Maſters come home, leap about them for joy, and in their language bid them welcome. Such a joy is here meant, a joy lifting up the heart, a leaping, an exulting joy. The word is often applied to the joy of the Saints, they rejoyce, and (as it were) leap about Jeſus Chriſt, they triumph in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God. The leaping, the exulting joy, the beſt joy, all the joy which an hypocrite hath, is but this, vvhich hath been deſcribed; Is it not a deſirable joy? a goodly joy ſure? the words are ironicall, <hi>This is the joy of his way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Of his way.]</hi> Way is taken for the courſe, purpoſe and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a mans life, for the tenour of his converſation, which he holds in the world, <hi>This is the joy of his way: This is it.</hi> The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is demonſtrative, This is it which I have told you; as if he had ſaid, caſt up all the comfort and happineſſe of that flouriſhing tree, of the hypocrite, this is all that it comes to, his end is to be rooted up, and not ſo much as to be owned by thoſe that knew him before.</p>
                     <p>There are three things which I ſhould obſerve from this, <hi>This is the joy of his way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, That an hypocrite may have much joy in his way. He may rejoyce much in his condition, and thinke all's well. <hi>Falſe hopes can produce falſe joyes.</hi> Falſe faith brings forth a comfort like it ſelf, a fading comfort, a ſhadow of comfort, as that is, but a ſhadow of faith. The fancy of faith is uſually fuller of joy then true faith. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan helps forward this joy, and God for a time will not hinder it. Faith (though feigned) gives the ſoul a ſight of ſuch things as are worth the rejoycing in, and a ſuppoſed title to them will move joy, as well as a reall title doth. The ſtony ground received the word with joy. The promiſes are delicious to the ſenſitive and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall part, as well as to the ſpirituall and regenerate part. Hence (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.) they that fall away are ſaid to have had taſtes of the <hi>joyes of the world to come.</hi> An hypocrite may thinke himſelf in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51057:61"/> ſometimes, and then like one in heaven, he cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce. <hi>He may have a glimpſe of heaven upon earth, all whoſe heaven is earth. This is his joy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>This,</hi> may be demonſtrative, and anſwers the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; what is his joy? It is this, His worldly comforts, his flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing outward condition is his chiefeſt joy. Then note, <hi>The joy of hypocrites is chiefly bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tomed upon outward things.</hi> It is not the joy of the Lord, no, nor joy in the Lord, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I ſay rejoyce,</hi> is the Goſpell-command. An hypocrite cannot rejoyce thus. When he rejoyces in the Lord, ſomewhat beſides the Lord cauſeth his joy. He rejoyces in his green boughs, in his goodly branches, in his ſuppoſed ſtrong root; but to rejoyce in God as God he knows not how. <hi>Davids</hi> joy was the oppoſite of this (Pſal. 4.6.) <hi>Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and that will put gladneſſe in my heart, more then in the time that their corn and wine encreaſed.</hi> Let me have the Sun-ſhine of thy love, and then though I have nothing but darkneſſe and clouds from the world, I ſhall rejoyce. But what ſaith the hypocrite? let my corn and wine encreaſe, let the Sunne of outward proſperity ſhine warm upon me, let me have my greenneſſe of creature-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, let me have credit and fair repute among men, theſe will put gladneſſe in my heart. Theſe glad his heart, when he hath not a dram of grace or goodneſſe there.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The joy of an hypocrite is but for a moment.</hi> It is a periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joy. <hi>This is the joy of his way;</hi> you ſee what it amounts to, how well it laſt. His greenneſſe is turned into withering, his root rots, and his fruit fals off. <hi>This is his joy.</hi> He is like thoſe ſpoken of in the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude</hi> (verſ. 14.) <hi>Trees twice dead, and plucked up by the roots.</hi> That's the concluſion of the hypocrite: he hath a name to live, but he is dead, <hi>twice dead,</hi> naturally dead in ſinne, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially dead under wrath: he was born ſpiritually dead, and his whole life is a paſſage to eternall death. He hath rejoyced a while, but he muſt mourn for ever. <hi>The portion of hypocrites is weeping and gnaſhing of teeth</hi> (Mat. 24.51.) Their joy is but for a morning or a day, weeping comes at night, &amp; that night hath no morning after it.</p>

                     <p>Again, <hi>Out of the earth ſhall others grow;</hi> they were not worth the ground they went upon, though they were worth a great deal of ground, therefore out of the ground ſhall others grow. God will raiſe up a generation which ſhall be more faithfull and ſerviceable unto him.</p>
                     <p>There is a fourth ſenſe of this expreſſion, <hi>Out of the earth ſhall others grow;</hi> that is, out of the meaneſt and loweſt condition others ſhall grow: and ſo it carries an oppoſition between the condition of an hypocrite, and of a godly man. The hypocrite in his flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing greenneſſe ſhall be cut down to the ground, but they whoſe hearts are ſincere and upright, though they are as low as the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51057:62"/> ground, though they are upon the earth, and are trodden down as mire in the ſtreets, yet they ſhall grow up. They who were growing high ſhall be cut down, and they who were below ſhall grow up; ſuch as they feared not, nor ſuſpected, ſhall prevail over them. <hi>They who are lowest, even as low as the earth, ſhall be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, built up and ſet on high in the world, when God speaks the word.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is an Expoſition of this whole context, about which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many cloſe with it) I ſhall give a brief account. Divers of the learned underſtand this third ſimilitude, not as deſcribing the ſtate of an hypocrite, but as an inſtance in oppoſition to the ſtate of an hypocrite, ſet forth by the ruſh and by the ſpider in the former verſes.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is that the <hi>Italian</hi> verſion begins the ſixteenth verſe thus, <hi>But the perfect man is green before the Sun,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo the ſenſe may be given to this effect. As if <hi>Bildad</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Though hypocrites wither like a ruſh, or like a flag, though they are ſuddenly ſwept down like a ſpiders web, yet a godly man is a green tree before the Sunne; he is not like a ruſh without water, but like a tree planted by the rivers ſide, which is able to endure the heat of the Sunne, yea the hottest Sunne of perſecution: [His branches ſhoot forth in his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den] he is no wilde tree, no tree of the foreſt, or of the wilderneſſe, he is a tree of the incloſed garden, which if it want the water from the clouds, the Gardener will take care to water it with his hand. Or [his roots are wrapped about the heap, about the fountain;] he is ſtrongly ſet, and he hath water continually to feed and ſupply his branches;</hi> Thus the Church is ſo deſcribed by <hi>Balaam</hi> (Numb. 24.6.) <hi>How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Iſrael! as the valleys are they ſpread forth, as gardens by the rivers ſides, as the trees of Lign aloes, which the Lord hath plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and as Cedar-trees beſides the waters. Thus the godly mans roots are wrapped about the fountain, and there he is fruitfull; though the Sunne ſhine hot upon him, yet it cannot exhale his moyſture faſter then the river can ſupply him with more. And he ſeeth the place of ſtones, he will live upon a flint, having a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly root of faith continually ſucking in refreſhings from Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe protection and favour he remains ſtrong and abounding in the worke of the Lord. [But if he deſtroy him from his place, it ſhall deny him] that is, if the wicked of the world attempt to root the godly man up: the place, that is, the men of the place ſhall take part with them, own him, and deny to give him up into the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51057:62"/> hands of thoſe who would deſtroy him. But if the place ſhould not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him, if the power and violence of the enemy deſtroy and pluck him up, yet this is his joy, a godly man may be deſtroyed, but none can deſtroy the joy of a godly man. [This is the joy of his way] he delights in perſecution, he is as ſorrowfull, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies rejoycing, even in death it ſelf, [And out of his earth ſhall others grow] He ſhall have a bleſſed poſterity to ſtand up in his ſtead, in whom he ſhall live, when he is dead. Or, if the power of the adverſary root him out of this earth, in which he lived, and drive him from this ground, from houſe and home, he ſhall grow in another earth</hi> (The originall may bear that ſenſe.<note place="margin">De terra alia germinabunt. <hi>Pagn.</hi>
                        </note>) <hi>If he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from this place, he ſhall grow in another place; if you take him from his owne Countrey, he can grow in any Countrey, and if he be plucked from all Countreys, he will grow up to, and in Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the whole Context may be made out as a ſimilitude of a godly man, in oppoſition to the hypocrite. But I rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſſe and ſettle in the interpretation before, that it is a third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the condition of an hypocrite. The originall and our tranſlation fairly carry it ſo.</p>

                        <hi>Bildad</hi> having thus farre proſecuted the point, vindicated the juſtice of God, and illuſtrated his former proof by a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſimilitude, ſhuts up and ſtates the point for God, that <hi>He is just, For he will not hurt the innocent, neither will he help the evil doers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        </bibl>
                        <p>Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers.</p>
                        <p>Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</p>
                        <p>They that hate thee ſhall be cloathed with ſhame, and the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place of the wicked ſhall come to nought.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THeſe three verſes are the epilogue or cloſe of <hi>Bildads</hi> diſcourſe with <hi>Job</hi> having in the former parts of the Chapter aſſerted, and with great clearneſſe illuſtrated the juſtice of God in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt impenitents and hypocrites; he now concludes in a mollifying language, with the aſſurance of his favour and goodneſſe unto thoſe who return and humble themſelves. Yet this he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weaves with threats of the diſpleaſure of God ſeen in the effects of it, againſt the wicked, in the twentieth and two and twentieth verſes.</p>
                  <p>It is, as if <hi>Bildad</hi> had thus ſaid, <hi>Behold, God will not caſt away a perfect man. Job, thou maiſt perceive, by what hath now been ſpoken, that God is no enemy to the righteous, nor no friend to wicked men: Thou ſeeſt what the portion of a wicked man is from God, and how juſt God is in giving him ſuch a portion; yet know, that mercy ſhall act as gloriouſly in the hand of God, as juſtice doth; as God is not unjuſt to favour hypocrites, ſo neither will he be unjuſt to forget the righteous and the perfect man: the hypocrite ſhall periſh, but he will fill the mouth of a godly man with laughing, and his lips with rejoycing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, if we conſider his ſpeech more diſtinctly, we may ſee two negative acts of juſtice, one toward the perfect, the other to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the hypocrite, with the effects of both.</p>
                  <p>His juſtice acts towards the perfect man, in that, <hi>He will not cast him away.</hi> The effect whereof is, <hi>The filling of his mouth with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his lips with rejoycing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His juſtice acts againſt the hypocrite, thus, <hi>He will not help the evil doers.</hi> The effect whereof is, That <hi>evil doers ſhall be cloathed with ſhame, and that their tabernacles ſhall not be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may caſt all into a form of argument. Firſt, to the generall; and then to the particular caſe of <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <p>He that doth not caſt away a perfect and a good man, is juſt and righteous in his dealings and adminiſtrations.</p>
                     <p>But God doth not, will not caſt away a perfect, and a good man.</p>
                     <p>Therefore he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </q>
                  <p>Then, to the particular caſe of <hi>Job.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He that doth not caſt away any perfect man, will not cast thee away, if thou art perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, <hi>Job,</hi> return, make thy way perfect before God, and <hi>He will not caſt thee away.</hi> Or take this inference. God will not caſt away a perfect man: therefore ſurely thou haſt a great deal of imperfection or inſincerity in thee, becauſe God hath thus caſt thee off, and laid thee aſide.</p>
                  <p>The like arguments may be framed upon the other part of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in his dealings with the wicked.</p>
                  <p>From the generall ſenſe of the Context thus given, I come to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the particulars, as they here lie in order.</p>

                        <hi>That God will not caſt away a perfect man;</hi> this is not all the meaning, as if God made no other reckoning of perfect men then thus, that he would not caſt them away; more is intended then expreſt, namely, that the Lord doth highly eſteem and prize righteous men; he laies them, as it were, in his boſome and next his heart: thus the Lord deals with the righteous, <hi>His not caſting away, is a near embracing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a two-fold caſting away; Firſt, Temporall. Secondly, Eternall: and in neither of theſe ſenſes doth God caſt away a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man.

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>A gracious ſoul ſhall never be rejected of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whatſoever God doth in the world, he will never doe this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>He hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> If God doth not leave a perfect man, he will not caſt him away. The Apoſtle puts the queſtion, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1.) <hi>Hath God caſt away his people? God forbid. God hath not cast away his people whom he fore-knew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Perfect men are Gods jewels, not the rubbiſh or off-ſcouring of the world, though the world count them ſo. A wiſe man will not caſt away jewels.</p>
                     <p>Perfect men are Gods ſervants, his faithfull ſervants; all the willing ſervice he hath done him in the world (on this ſide Angels) is done by theſe men. A wiſe man will not caſt away ſuch as are truly ſerviceable unto him.</p>
                     <p>Perfect men are Gods children; they are borne of God, and ſonnes of the moſt high. Naturall love will not caſt away a childe.</p>
                     <p>Perfect men are Gods portion, the lot of his inheritance, his
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51057:64"/> revenue comes in, he hath his in-comes of glory, by them. A man will not deſpiſe his own glory, he will not reject his own inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                     <p>Further, They who are perfect come to him in his Sonne; and he hath pawned his truth for it (<hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37.) <hi>He that commeth to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out:</hi> As if he had ſaid, this thing is furtheſt from my heart of any thing in the world. God cals after many who goe away from him, but he caſts away none who come to him. None come to him till he draws them, therefore he will not drive them away who come.</p>
                     <p>Again, Perfect men have the Spirit of God, God cannot caſt away, or ſtop his ears at the voice of his own Spirit. They have the earneſt of his Spirit; if God ſhould go about to put them off, or lay them aſide, they will ſhew God thoſe tokens and pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of his love, the earneſt he hath given them to aſſure their hearts.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, He hath tied himſelf to them in the bond of a Covenant, they are faſt to him in the everlaſting bonds of his own love; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot be caſt off. So he promiſes his people (<hi>Levit.</hi> 26.44.) though they ſhould provoke him to afflict them, yet he would not reject them utterly; he might put them into the hands of their enemies, but he would never ceaſe to be their friend, <hi>For all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not caſt them away.</hi> (Many think when the Saints are caſt into trouble, that God hath caſt them away: no, there is no ſuch matter, when they are in their enemies hand, God holds them ſtill in his hand, yea, in his heart.) <hi>I will not caſt them away, neither will I abhorre them to deſtroy them utterly, and to break my Covenant with them, for I am the Lord their God.</hi> The Covenant holdeth God and his people ſo faſt together, that they ſhall never part.</p>
                     <p>We finde the Church complaining grievouſly, as if ſhe were caſt away (Pſal. 44.9.) <hi>Thou haſt caſt us off, and put us to ſhame, and goest not forth with our Armies:</hi> and verſe 23. the Church praies, <hi>Ariſe, O Lord, caſt us not off for ever.</hi> So (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.1.) <hi>O God, thou haſt caſt us off:</hi> and verſ. 9. <hi>Who will bring me into the ſtrong City? Wilt not thou, O God, which hadſt caſt us off?</hi> God (to ſenſe) caſts off his own people, when he caſteth them into dangers: but even then their faith takes hold of God, and Gods love takes hold of them. Though all this be come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, nor dealt falſely in thy Covenant (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.17.) neither
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51057:65"/> had God forgotten them, or dealt falſly in the Covenant: they were his people ſtill, and as near unto him, as when they were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from thoſe troubles.</p>
                     <p>God caſts away ſome indeed, but they are ſuch as he never had within the bonds of his Covenant. He caſts away wicked men, as rubbiſh, as filth and dirt; ſuch the Prophet ſpeaks of (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.15.) <hi>My God will cast them away, becauſe they did not hearken unto him.</hi> Theſe were imperfect, not perfect men. God caſt theſe away, not from any intereſt they had in him, but becauſe they never had any. Such as will not hearken unto the Word of God, God will caſt away; why? They caſt God away, when they caſt the Word of God away. They caſt the Covenant behinde their backs (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.) no wonder God caſts them behinde his back; he throws them o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t of doors, when they throw his truth out of their hearts. Perfect men love the truth of God for ever, and the God of truth loves them for ever.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, (For, as was ſaid, theſe words expreſſe leſſe then is meant.) Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That perfect men are highly eſteemed by God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He prizes them greatly, he delighteth in them, <hi>They that honour me, I will honour,</hi> ſaith God; not only will I not caſt them away, or abhorre them, but I will honour them. God eſteems and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes them, though the world diſeſteem and reject them. There is many a ſoul which the world tramples under their feet, as the mire in the ſtreets, which at that time God laies in his boſom. Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth ſome in his arms, whom the world, yea, whom their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren hate, and ſmite with their tongues (Iſa. 66.5.) <hi>Your brethren that hated you, that caſt you out for my Names ſake, ſaid, Let the Lord be glorified</hi> (Not only the wicked world may doe this, but bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, even thoſe that are brethren indeed in the main, may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly hate a perfect man, and caſt him out) your brethren that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you, and caſt you out for my Names ſake; but the Lord at that time loved them, as it follows, <hi>But he ſhall appear to your joy, and they ſhall be aſhamed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if God doth not only not caſt away perfect ones, but eſteem them, then take theſe three cautions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Ye that are perfect, be ſure ye keep cloſe to God, doe not caſt him off; doe not caſt away the word, any one truth or command of God. Caſt not the waies of God away, for he will never caſt you away.</p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:51057:65"/>
                     <p>Secondly, Ye that are perfect, <hi>Caſt not away your confidence,</hi> Heb. 10.35. The Apoſtle had ſhewed how cloſe God would ſtick to his people; now, ſaith he, if it be ſo, if he will bring his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to paſſe, <hi>then caſt not away your confidence.</hi> There is a great ſtrength of engagement in it, when we read that God will not caſt away his people, that they ſhould not caſt away their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, <hi>which hath great recompence of reward.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly to all, take heed of caſting of caſting off or ſleighting any perfect man; we ſhould act towards men, and thinke of them as God doth. It is beſt to love where God loves, and to love moſt where he loves moſt. <hi>Negative promiſes, and negative threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings have greateſt force in them.</hi> God holds them faſteſt; and loves them deareſt, of whom he ſaith, I will not caſt them away. <hi>God will not caſt away a perfect man.</hi> There's a negative promiſe. Now ſee the portion of the wicked, that's given out in a negative threatning: God ſaith not what he will doe againſt them, but what he will not do for them, <hi>Neither will he help the evil doers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>He will not help them.</q>
                     <p>Some read it, <hi>He will not put forth his hand to evil doers.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Non perrigit manum malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis. <hi>Vulg.</hi> Ad a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                           </gap>tiae foedus pertinere videtur.</note> So the letter of the Hebrew imports. And there may be a three-fold ſenſe given of that reading. <hi>Putting forth the hand,</hi> notes, firſt, our taking men into ſociety, fellowſhip and familiarity with us: when we would ſhew a man how we love him at our hearts, we put forth a hand, and take him by the hand. Now (ſaith he) God will not take an evil doer by the hand, to welcome or entertain him, to countenance and reſpect him (Exod. 23.1.) <hi>Put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witneſſe:</hi> Be not of the ſame ſide, communion and fellowſhip with him, in giving witneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, (As the Septuagint gives the ſenſe) <hi>He will not put forth his hand;</hi> that is, to receive a gift or an offering from wicked men. When a gift or a preſent is brought, the receiver (if he would teſtifie his liking and acceptance of it) puts forth his hand and receives it.<note place="margin">Nec ullum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus impij acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier. <hi>Sept. q. d.</hi> Non por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riget manus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepturus manus, impiorum dona non ſunt Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grata. <hi>Pined.</hi>
                        </note> Now (ſaith <hi>Bildad) God will not put forth his hand</hi> to receive any offering or gift from wicked men; the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of wicked men are an abomination unto the Lord, <hi>The good deeds of evil doers are evil in his ſight. He had no reſpect to Cain and his offering.</hi> He did not put forth his hand to receive <hi>Cains</hi> offering, but he put forth his hand to receive <hi>Abels</hi> offering. This is a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſenſe.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, It rather refers to Gods not aſſiſting wicked men. So M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Broughton</hi> renders it, <hi>He will not maintain the hand of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous.</hi> To put forth or ſtretch out the hand, according to this Hebrew phraſe,<note place="margin">

                        </note> implies ſtrong holding, or the taking of ſtrong hold upon any thing, ſo as by taking hold of it to ſtrengthen and confirm it, to give it help and aſſiſtance. A man that would give aſſiſtance to another in any buſineſſe or work, puts forth his hand to him. When we want help, we uſually beſpeak a friend, <hi>Pray lend me your hand.</hi> Now here, <hi>The Lord will not put forth his hand to evil doers;</hi> that is, the Lord gives them no aſſiſtance or help in their wickedneſſe. If wicked men ſay, Lord, <hi>lend us thy hand:</hi> no, ſaith he, I will not lend you my hand. We finde this phraſe frequent in Scripture. That (<hi>Gen.</hi> 19.16.) illuſtrates it fully; where <hi>Lot</hi> being warned to go out of <hi>Sodome</hi> (verſ. 16.) <hi>while he lingred the men</hi> (that is, the Angels) <hi>laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercifull unto him, and they brought him forth, and ſet him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the City.</hi> They laid hold upon their hands: It is the word of the text. When the Lord ſees wicked men, in any diſtreſſe or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (as <hi>Lot</hi> was in <hi>Sodome</hi>) or when they want help and aſſiſtance in any buſineſſe, he will not be mercifull to them in taking them by the hand, or in laying his hand ſtrongly upon them, either to pull them out of the danger, or to give them help in difficulties. The ſinne of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is charged upon her in this language by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, in a parity with that of filthy <hi>Sodome.</hi> (Ezek. 16.49.) <hi>Neither did ſhe ſtrengthen the hand of the poor and needy:</hi> that is, ſhe did not relieve, comfort or help them. The ſinne oppoſite to this is charged upon the falſe Prophets by <hi>Jeremy</hi> (Chap. 23.14.) <hi>They ſtrengthen the hands of evil doers,</hi> either by counſell or by counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, by flatteries or connivence. We read (<hi>Nehem.</hi> 6.) how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the enemies ſent falſe alarms to <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and the people that were with him, to terrifie and affright them: <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſhews the enemies deſign in it, verſ. 9. <hi>They all made us afraid, ſaying, their hands ſhall be weakned from the work that it be not done;</hi> therefore in the cloſe <hi>Nehemiah</hi> praies, <hi>Lord, ſtrengthen mine hands</hi> (it is this word) as if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord, help me, put thine hands to mine.</hi> So (Iſa. 35.3.) <hi>ſtrengthen the weak hands,</hi> put your hands to their hands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.23. <hi>David</hi> acknowledging how he had almoſt fallen at the riſing of the wicked, ſhews yet what kept him up, <hi>Nevertheleſſe, I am continually with thee, thou haſt holden me by my right hand:</hi> the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51057:66"/> hand of providence is the power of God upholding our being, as the hand of Creation was the power of God giving us our being, Iſa. 42.6. <hi>I the Lord have called thee in righteouſneſſe, and I will hold thine hand and help thee.</hi> So, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.13. that is, by holding of thine hand I will help thee. The ſame word in the originall is uſed for hardening the heart (<hi>Exod.</hi> 9.12.<note place="margin">

                        </note>) becauſe hardneſſe of heart ſtrengthens it to doe evil. A hard heart is armed for any ſinne.</p>
                     <p>So then we ſee, when the Lord refuſeth to put forth his hand, or to take ſtrong hold (as the word imports) upon the hand of evil men, the meaning lies in one of theſe three things,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That he bears no favour to them, he doth not approve their cauſe or buſineſſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That he gives them no aſſiſtance nor encouragement in their buſineſſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That he will not deliver or reſcue them out of their diſtreſſes; when they are ſinking and falling he will not put forth his hand to hold them up, or to keep them from ſinking. God is hot a Patron or a Protectour, an Adjutor or Aider of evil doers.</p>
                     <q>Evil doers.</q>
                     <p>We muſt not take theſe evil doers for all and every one that doth evil, <hi>for then whom would God help?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>
                        </note> We may then ſay (with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) <hi>God help us</hi> indeed: what a miſerable condition were we then in, if God would not put forth his hand to help any that do evil? The evil doer is a man notoriouſly, profeſſedly, ſtudiouſly wicked, one that acts and deviſes evil againſt God and his waies. Every one who doth evil is not to be reckon'd an evil doer. A man doth evil in any one act: but one act doth not make him an evil doer. A Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate muſt count him an evil doer, who doth evil; and therefore he muſt take vengeance (in many caſes) <hi>of him that doth evil</hi> (though but once) <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. and though he repent. The Angels were caſt as evil doers for one act, and ſo was man in innocency: but now the evil doer is one who multiplies and continues in evil deeds; to ſuch as theſe the Lord will not put forth his hand, or give them his help. Obſerve then,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That God is no friend, no aſſiſtant unto men in ſinfull waies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He will not ſtrengthen the hands, or help forward the work of wicked men. God is the puniſher and judge of evil doers, therefore not their helper.</p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:51057:67"/>
                     <p>Evil doers oppoſe not only Gods law, but his nature, therefore he will not help them. He cannot exerciſe one Attribute againſt another; his power will not work againſt his holineſſe, or againſt his will.</p>
                     <p>There is a two-fold help which God giveth,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, A common help.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A ſpeciall help.</p>
                     <p>We grant that God ſtrengthens the hands even of evil doers in regard of a common help: For no man could put forth his hand to any evil, as a ſinner, if God did not give him a generall aſſiſtance, as a creature. In this ſenſe the ſtrength by which men rebell and ſinne againſt God, comes from God. But he doth not ſtrengthen their hands, or give them help by any ſpeciall aſſiſtance. In the doing of good, we have a common aſſiſtance to the act, as there is a naturall motion in it, which God gives his people with the reſt of the world: but this will not carry them out to doe good compleatly. To bring forth any gracious act, they muſt have a ſpeciall aſſiſtance. Hence Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Without me ye can do nothing;</hi> he means it not of that generall ſupport which Chriſt gives to man, by which <hi>all live and move, and have their being in him</hi> (in that ſenſe no man is able to doe any thing without Chriſt, for in him all things conſ ſt) but when he ſaith, <hi>Without me ye can doe nothing,</hi> he means, without my ſpeciall aſſiſtance and ſtrength ye cannot perform holy and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all duties, acceptable unto God. So the Apoſtle, <hi>We have no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of our ſelves, ſo much as to thinke a good thought.</hi> We have no ſufficiency to thinke any thought without ſome aſſiſtance; but to thinke a good thought, we have not any ſufficiency without a ſpeciall aſſiſtance. Wicked men are not able to doe evil, without a common aſſiſtance; but they have no ſpeciall aſſiſtance from God to do evil. He doth neither ſtir up and excite then luſts to the act, nor ſupply their luſts while they are acting. Wicked men have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance enough in both from their own hearts, and from Satan. Though man hath no ſufficiency in himſelf to thinke one good thought, yet he hath a ſufficiency in himſelf to thinke all evil thoughts; As he is a creature he acts, and as he is a corrupt creature he ſins. Man hath full power and free-will to do evil therefore the Lord doth not put forth his hand to help the evil doer.</p>
                     <p>But it will be neceſſary for the underſtanding of this and other like Scripture, to conſider ſomewhat more diſtinctly, what God doth in reference to evil acts, or the acts of evil doers. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51057:67"/> but not with ſuch a concurrence, as amounts to the helping of evil doers, or the ſtrengthening of their hands.</p>
                     <p>The firſt help which God gives evil doers, is privative, or negative, the calling in, or not giving out of that power, by which they might do good, or avoid evil. Thus he departed from <hi>Saul</hi> and then <hi>Saul</hi> went on, worſe and worſe againſt <hi>David.</hi> God hath ſomewhat to doe with evil doers, when he with-draws that help from them, by which they might be kept from doing evil. Or, when he doth not aſſiſt them againſt the evil of their own hearts, and the pollutions of the world. This deſerting and leaving them unto themſelves, laies them open to ſin. Yet the ſin which a man thus deſerted commits, can no more be charged upon God, then the darkneſſe of the night can be charged upon the Sunne for going down; ſinne follows divine deſertion, not as an effect doth the cauſe, but as a conſequent doth it's antecedent.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He delivers or gives them up, firſt, to Satan: And ſecondly, to their own counſels, to a reprobate minde and vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.24, 26. This tradition is an act beyond deſertion; there is a greater ſpirituall judgement in it, when God makes a mans own wickedneſſe active againſt him, then when he doth not make his Spirit or grace active in him. It were better to be put into the hands of all the tyrants in the world, yea, better be put into the hands of the devil, then into the hands of our own luſts and paſſions. <hi>God doth not give a reprobate minde or vile affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but he gives up to them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Evil doers in their doing evil are ordered by God. Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men (in every ſinfull act) runne beyond the line of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but they cannot runne beyond the line of providence. God limits and circumſcribes the acts of wicked men, for otherwiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very wicked man would be a <hi>monſter, a none-ſuch</hi> in wickedneſſe, if he could; every one would be a <hi>Cain,</hi> an <hi>Ahab,</hi> a <hi>Nero,</hi> a <hi>Cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula,</hi> &amp;c. The ſinfulneſſe of men would be, not only out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſinfull <hi>intenſive,</hi> in regard of the quality of it, but out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſinfull <hi>extenſive,</hi> in regard of the quantity of it, it would break all bounds, carry all down before it, did not the Lord order and direct the diſorders and confuſions of it. There is a ſea of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the heart of a wicked man, which is as boyſterous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly as the naturall ſea, and if the Lord did not ſet bounds to that ſea of wickedneſſe, and ſay, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come and no further,</hi> it would overwhelm all. Thus farre alſo God hath to doe in the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51057:68"/> ſinfulneſſe of men, to limit and ſtay them, to reſtrain and keep them in compaſſe, while they ſinne. Every ſinne goes without the compaſſe of that law which God hath given, but no ſinne can get beyond the compaſſe of that leave which God gives.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, We may ſay, <hi>God aſſiſts the motions of ſinne, but not the motions to ſinne, or the ſinfulneſſe of the motion.</hi> The ſtrength of a wicked mans hand, while he ſins is from the Lord, but the Lord doth not ſtrengthen his hand to ſinne. A ſinner hath naturall help from God, but he hath no morall help from God; he hath all that from himſelf, from his own wicked heart, or from Satan. To eat was a naturall act in our firſt parents, this was from God; but to eat againſt the command was a morall act, and that was from man, and the ſerpent. As ſuppoſe that a Muſician ſhould touch or play upon a Lute that is out of tune, his touching the Lute is an artificiall act, but the ſounding of it comes from the nature of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the ſounding of the inſtrument is from the hand of him that plaies upon it, but, that it ſounds untuneably, is, becauſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is out of tune. So the Lord by naturall aſſiſtance puts the hearts and hands of wicked men into motion, but that they move ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly, that they make ſuch harſh muſick, that there is ſo much diſcord in their actions, that's from the diſorder and untuneable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their own ſpirits, not from the hand of God. They have not any morall aſſiſtance from God in ſinne, but a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall only.</p>
                     <p>Or, take it negatively, <hi>God doth not help the evil doers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, He doth not help the evil doers, by inſtilling the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of evil into them. He caſts in, or infuſes holy thoughts and motions into the hearts of his own people, to prepare them for holy performances, but he never dropt the leaſt motion of evil into the heart of man, to fit him for wickedneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Lord doth not excite or ſtir up that naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent corruption that is in wicked men; he doth not provoke or blow up their luſts. He excites the graces of his own people, when they are to doe any good: they have a principle of grace in them, and this God breaths upon, moving and acting it by freſh aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Neither of theſe waies doth the Lord aſſiſt evil doers.</p>
                     <p>Further, Taking the words (as they muſt) in a figure, when it is ſaid, <hi>God doth not help the evil doers;</hi> the meaning is, he doth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſiſt them. Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wicked men are reſiſted and oppoſed by God in their evil doings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:51057:68"/>
                     <p>God is ſo farre from giving them any help, that he ſets himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Underſtand this with a diſtinction.</p>
                     <p>There is a two-fold reſiſtance or oppoſition that God makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the evil doings of men. There is,
<list>
                           <item>1. A morall oppoſition.</item>
                           <item>2. A naturall oppoſition.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or there is,
<list>
                           <item>1. A declarative reſiſtance.</item>
                           <item>2. An operative reſiſtance.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>When it is ſaid, that God doth reſiſt (as this phraſe imports or ſuppoſeth) wicked men in doing evil, we are to underſtand it, that he ever oppoſes them morally; that is, he ever laies a morall impediment in their way, and he ever oppoſes them declarative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he declares his oppoſition in his Word. He never ſhews the leaſt liking of wicked men in their waies. For when he ſaith, <hi>He that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill, and he that is unjust, let him be unjust ſtill</hi> (Revel. 22.11.) he doth not at all approve, but threatens theſe ſinners. This ſeeming admiſſion is the higheſt rebuke of ſinne. But take it for a naturall oppoſition, which is the bringing out of ſtrength and power to ſtop men in the waies of ſin: Thus the Lord doth not alwaies reſiſt evil doers. For if he did, it were impoſſible that any wicked man ſhould move one hairs breadth in doing evil; if God would put forth his power againſt man, he could not ſtir to ſin againſt God: but God doth not ſo, neither is he bound to lay a naturall impediment in the waies of wicked men. It is enough to acquit him in his holineſſe, that he ever laies a morall impediment in their way. He declareth his law againſt, and his diſlike of their ſins: and in this ſenſe he alwaies reſiſts them. All the ſinne of man is againſt the will of God, yet no man ſins whether God will or no. The declarative will of God is often reſiſted, but his operative will cannot be reſiſted. As (which may illuſtrate this) in the civill State, the laws of this Kingdome lay a morall impediment in the way of thievery and robbery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is perpetually declared by the law, that no man ought to take another mans eſtate from him vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently; but yet the Kingdome doth not ever ſet a naturall impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt, robbers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That is, we doe not place a power of men to guard all high waies or houſes, to ſee that no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger ſhall be robbed, or houſe broken open: So the Lord laies a morall impediment in the way of wicked men alwaies, but he doth not alwaies ſet his power againſt them, whereby he is able
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51057:69"/> (if he pleaſe) to diſable wicked men from doing evil. Thirdly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When wicked men are going down, down they ſhall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Why? God will not put forth his hand to help them; they, whom God will not aſſiſt or help, cannot ſtand long. They in the Pſalm thought they had got the godly man at an advantage, <hi>Come</hi> (ſay they) <hi>let us perſecute and take him, for God hath forſaken him, and there is none to deliver him;</hi> Now we may have our wils of this man, for God ſtands by and doth not own him. If God be a neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his friends cannot ſtand long, how then ſhall his enemies ſtand, when he is their oppoſer? We may conclude againſt wicked men, that they ſhall be deſtroyed, for God hath forſaken them, he will not own them; and as <hi>Hamans</hi> wife told him ſadly, <hi>Eſt.</hi> 6.13. <hi>If Mordecai be of the ſeed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou ſhalt ſurely fall before him.</hi> When a man is going down, nothing can ſtay him, if God doe not: his hand muſt ſupport a ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tottering perſon or Nation, or elſe either fals. When wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked enemies begin to fall, they ſhall fall and periſh, for God will not put forth his hand to help the evil doers.</p>
                     <p>Now follows the effect of all. The effect firſt of Gods gracious helping of the righteous, <hi>He will not caſt away the righteous man;</hi> and is that all? Shall a righteous man be only not rejected? As mans duty ought not, ſo the mercy of God doth not ſtay in nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. The Lord hath poſitive bleſſings in ſtore for his people; the later part of the promiſe affirms this, <hi>He will not caſt away the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man.</hi>

This word is applied ſometimes to that rude ſound, or confuſed noiſe, which ſouldiers make when they come on to charge in battell; they commonly make a great cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, to ſtrike the adverſary with terrour and amazement, and to encourage and raiſe their own ſpirits. The Greeks and Latins have their ſpeciall terms to expreſſe it by, noted by the learned in the proprieties of thoſe languages.</p>
                     <p>Again, That word is uſed for the confuſed noiſe of worſted or conquer'd enemies, when they flee and runne away. So (<hi>Judg.</hi> 7.31.) when <hi>Gideon</hi> had diſcomfited the hoſt of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> all the hoſt <hi>ran and cried</hi> they made a dolefull ſound: ſo the word bears, as well as a joyfull ſound.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The word is chiefly uſed to note the ſound or acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſouldiers after victory is obtained; a prevailing army ſhouts when the adverſe forces are routed and overcome. Thus, in that famous inſtance (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 6.5.) <hi>Joſhua</hi> gives command, that when they make a long blaſt with the rams horns, and when they heard the ſound of the trumpet, all the people ſhould <hi>ſhout with a great ſhout.</hi> Which ſhout is expreſſed by the word of the text, and in the tenth
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51057:70"/> verſe he charges that they ſhould not ſhout or make a noiſe with their voice till the ſeventh day, becauſe that was deſigned for the day of victory, the day when the wall ſhould fall: <hi>You ſhall not ſhout nor make any noiſe with your voice, neither ſhall any word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of your mouths, till the day I bid you ſhout, then ſhall ye ſhout. Balaam</hi> (Numb. 23.21.) confeſſes he could not curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the ſhout of a King was amongſt them.</hi> It is this word.

Thus when <hi>Samuel</hi> brought <hi>Saul</hi> out, whom he had anointed for King, and ſaid, <hi>See ye him whom the Lord hath choſen that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people ſhouted, and ſaid, God ſave the King,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.24.</p>
                     <p>Or ſecondly, It noteth ſuch a ſhout as is in an army, where a King in perſon is leader or victour.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The ſhout of a King is amongſt them, becauſe the voice of a King ſhould be as the ſound of a trumpet, or ſome loud inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to enform and direct his people, as alſo to enourage them.</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51057:71"/> men. Though laughing, as it is a naturall act, is common to all men, yet in the ſenſe we ſpeak of, laughter is appropriated unto godly and perfect men: <hi>They only can laugh indeed who have mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tibi ridet &amp; mihi, non ſibi.</note> A wicked man doth but feign a laugh. <hi>He laughs to thee and to me, but he doth not laugh to himſelf:</hi> He hath no true laughter, while he laughs. His laughter is madneſſe, and proceeds from his ignorance, not from his reaſon. Beſides other marks of difference which ſhall be put between the ſervants of God and their enemies, this is one, <hi>My ſervants ſhall rejoyce, and ye ſhall be aſhamed</hi> (Iſa. 65.13.) This joy ariſes two waies.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, From the greatneſſe of the bleſſing, which they receive for themſelves. We muſt rejoyce in the leaſt mercy, how greatly then in the greateſt? Our joyes take their meaſure by our mercies. When <hi>Sarah</hi> had a Son, ſhe ſaid, <hi>God hath made me to laugh, ſo that all that hear me ſhall laugh with me,</hi> Gen. 21.6. Her mercy in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſonne was ſo great, that it would ſerve a whole world to make merry with. The man that had found his loſt ſheep, <hi>laid it on his ſhoulders, rejoycing</hi> (it was a pleaſant burden to him) <hi>and when he came home, he called together his friends and neighbours, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Rejoyce with me</hi> (Luk. 15.6.) As ſome afflictions are ſo big, that all our own ſorrows are not large enough to weep and mourn over them: ſo ſome bleſſings are ſo big, that they call out more then our own affections to rejoyce over them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This overflowing joy ariſes from the greatneſſe of thoſe judgements, which are poured out upon the enemies of the Saints. The overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> at the red ſea, of <hi>Jabin</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſera</hi> at the brook <hi>Kiſhon,</hi> filled all hearts and mouths with laughter, and ſo ſhall the overthrow of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Rev. 15.</p>
                     <p>Thus, when God doth great things for his people, and great things againſt his enemies, then it is time to rejoyce greatly (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.1.) <hi>The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we rejoyce,</hi> ſay the captive Jews in the morning or firſt dawnings of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from <hi>Babylon;</hi> and more then ſo, <hi>Then was our mouth fill'd with laughter, and our tongue with ſinging.</hi> And there is cauſe of great rejoycing in thoſe great things, becauſe then God fulfils his promiſes, and makes his Name glorious in his providences. Then God is greatly honoured, when his people are greatly delivered; then the blaſphemies of wicked men are unanſwerably confuted, and their mouths for ever ſtopped. From all theſe conſiderations the hearts of the Saints are filled with laughter, and their mouths with
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51057:71"/> rejoycing in a day when God works great things. At ſuch times joy, and this degree of it, is not only our priviledge, but our duty. When we carry a meſſage of thanks to God, we muſt not come with uncheerfull countenances, or ſowr faces. It is a comely thing, when our affections keep time and proportion with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations of God. When we cannot ſing the ſongs of <hi>Sion,</hi> or uſe our harps by the waters of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and when we cannot but ſing either in the reſtoring of <hi>Sion,</hi> or in the ruines of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some may object thoſe texts, <hi>Woe to them that laugh,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Luk.</hi> 6.25.) It ſeems laughter is the portion of wicked men, for woe (we are ſure) is their portion. It's true, worldly laughter, a laughter in corn, and wine, and oil, a laughter in riches, and honours, and carnall pleaſures, as ſuch, is a laughter with a woe annexed. But to laugh in the ſenſe of the goodneſſe of God, giving us outward good things to expreſſe our ſelves joyfully, when God expreſſes himſelf graciouſly, is not only comely, but holy. When Gods heart comes out at his hand, and is ſeen in his actions, our hearts ſhould come out at our mouths, and be heard in our exultations.</p>
                     <p>Thus we have ſeen the effect of the goodneſſe of God upon his own people. See the effect of his juſtice upon wicked men.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, It is taken comparatively for a leſſer or more remiſſe putting forth of love. He may be ſaid to hate, who wants a due heat and height of love.

Take hatred in the common notion, and then ſurely <hi>Jacob</hi> was not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51057:72"/> a man ſo forgetfull of a husbands duty, as to hate his wife: the meaning then is only this, <hi>The Lord ſaw that Leah had a leſſe portion of love than Rachel had, or leſſe then her conjugall relation called for.

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Shame ariſes from long delay, or detainments much beyond expectation. When <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtaid long in the Mount, <hi>the people were aſhamed</hi> (Exod. 32.1.) So <hi>Judg.</hi> 3.25. when <hi>Eglon</hi> ſtaid long in the inner parlour, the text ſaith, his ſervants, who waited with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, were aſhamed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Shame ariſeth from utter diſappointments. If hope deferred cauſeth ſhame, then much more hope deſtroyed. When a man ſees his hopes quite cut off, ſo that he can no way reach the thing he looked for, ſhame takes hold of him ſtrongly. <hi>David</hi> praies (Pſal. 119.116.) <hi>

                     <p>Evil doers ſhall be aſhamed upon theſe three grounds, they have done things againſt common light. They ſhall ſtay waiting and gaping long for what they deſire. They ſhall ſee themſelves total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappointed and defeated in their deſires; hence ſhame ſhall fill their faces, and they ſhall be covered with it as with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Here is more then bare ſhame waiting upon them, the text ſaith, <hi>They ſhall be cloathed with ſhame.</hi> To be cloathed is applied both to ornament and diſhonour. There are three degrees of expreſſion in Scripture about ſhame.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Barely to be <hi>aſhamed,</hi> that's the loweſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To have the face covered with ſhame; <hi>Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord God of hoſts, be aſhamed for my ſake. Becauſe for thy ſake I have born reproach, ſhame hath covered my face</hi> (Pſal. 69.6, 7.) The Prophet complains, that his face was covered with ſhame; his enemies endeavoured to blot and aſperſe him, they poured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and reproaches upon his face, that is, upon his reputation in the world (to doe ſo, is to cover the face with ſhame) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                        <hi>To be cloathed with ſhame</hi> notes four things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The extent or abundance of it. To be cloathed with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, is to have much honour. To be cloathed with humility, is to be very humble (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5.) He that is cloathed is covered all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with his cloathing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The publikeneſſe of it, that ſhame cannot be hid. A man cannot goe abroad but his cloathingis ſeen:<note place="margin">Manifeſtè con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundentur. <hi>Aqu.</hi>
                        </note> the filthineſſe which lies underneath may be hid, but his cloathing cannot. Their ſhame ſhall cloath them, they ſhall not put their ſhame under their cloaths, their ſhame ſhall be in ſight.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They <hi>ſhall be cloathed with ſhame,</hi> may be underſtood thus,<note place="margin">Eſt quaſi prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium peccati, mercedis onim nomine Syndones olim dabantur.</note> 
                        <hi>Shame ſhall be their reward.</hi> They have been doing the buſines of Satan, he ſet them a work, now ſee what livery they ſhall have at laſt, into what ſute the devil will put them. They ſhall goe in a livery of diſhonour.

                     <p>Fourthly, If we take the letter of the Hebraiſme, <hi>to be cloathed with ſhame</hi> implies thus much, that when a man hath done a thing of which he is aſhamed; he (as it were) ſends forth bloud into
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51057:73"/> the face, in a bluſh, to cover that foul act, he puts out a red gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a ſcarlet vail to hide his filthineſſe. Thus he is cloathed with ſhame. Modeſty commands nature, and (where it is but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly natur'd) prevails with it to caſt this covering over all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comelines in ſpeech or practice; and though this bluſh appears only in the face, yet the whole body is dipt and died with the ſame color.</p>
                     <p>Hence alſo they who are aſhamed,<note place="margin">Solent qui eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſcunt manum faciei, quia op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrium ac de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decus timent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movere. <hi>Bold.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They glory in their ſhame</hi> (Phil. 3.19.) not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, but materially. No man can glory in any thing under the notion of ſhame, but many glory in that which is in it ſelf ſhamefull,<note place="margin">

The Hebrew expreſſes an Idol, by a word that ſignifies ſhame, or a ſhamefull thing (and it is the root of that in the text) becauſe Idols, firſt or laſt, make their worſhippers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.13. <hi>According to the number of thy Cities were thy gods, O Judah, ye have ſet up altars to that ſhamefull thing.</hi> Idolaters ſhall ſee at laſt how fooliſh they have been in worſhipping a ſtock or a ſtone, in adoring the inventions of their own brains, which can do them no good in an evil day: every Idol is a ſhamefull thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it deceiveth it's worſhippers: ſo every ſinfull act will be like an Idol, matter of ſhame, becauſe every ſin is a deceit, Iſa. 26. <hi>They ſhall be aſhamed for their envy at my people:</hi> They ſhall ſee their envy againſt the people of God was unreaſonable, groundleſſe and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, therefore they ſhall be aſhamed; and if they ſhall be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their envy againſt the people of God, how ſhall they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of their oppoſition and injuries, of their oppreſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, Iſa. 41.11. <hi>Behold all they that were incenſed against thee ſhall be aſhamed.</hi> The Churches enemies glory in their own ſhame, and the Church ſhall glory in the ſhame of her enemies; therefore ſhe is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to behold it, as a piece of her glory.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, To think aright of the juſtice and judgements of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To humble himſelf and ſeek unto God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, (Which is implied in both the former) To forbear complaining of his own troubled life, or deſiring the end of it by death.</p>
                  <p>To theſe three heads of <hi>Bildads</hi> advice or reproof, <hi>Job</hi> ſhapes his anſwer in this 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He opens his thoughts about, and highly magnifies the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, to the 21. verſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He renounces his own righteouſneſſe, and proves that no man is to be judged by the preſent dealings of God with him, from the 21. verſe to the end of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He renews and juſtifies his complaint againſt his life, and his wiſhes for death, by many arguments, in the tenth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>In moſt of theſe points he anſwers exactly, according to the ſtrict laws and rules of diſputation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Repeating his Opponents argument, and then yeelding what was true, denying what was falſe, and diſtinguiſhing about what was doubtfull. Which he doth with ſo much acuteneſſe and vigour, with ſo much ſtrength and clearneſſe both of reaſon and judgement, that one of the Ancients cries out upon the whole
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51057:75"/> matter of his anſwer in theſe Chapters, <hi>O how much Philoſophy (I may ſay,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bildads</hi> argument ſpeaks to this effect; <hi>God who hath puniſhed thee is just, therefore thou art unjuſt. Job</hi> in anſwer, grants the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, but denies the conſequent. His grant of the antecedent appears in the two firſt verſes of the Chapter, <hi>I know it is ſo of a truth</hi> (I yeeld this) <hi>but how ſhould man be juſt with God?</hi> He proves and confirms that God is juſt, in the fourth verſe, by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>medium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, From his wiſdome, <hi>He is wiſe in heart.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From his power, <hi>He is mighty in ſtrength.</hi> What force there is in theſe two Attributes to hold up the juſtice of God, we ſhall ſee afterwards.</p>
                  <p>The fourth verſe is likewiſe a conceſſion unto the ſecond part of <hi>Bildads</hi> advice, namely, that <hi>Job</hi> ſhould humble himſelf. As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, <hi>You adviſe me to humble my ſelf, and to ſeek unto God, it is moſt becomming I ſhould doe ſo, for, he is wiſe in heart and mighty in ſtrength; Who hath hardened himſelf againſt him, and hath proſpered?</hi> There is no ſtanding out againſt God, and therefore I yeeld, I fall down and abaſe my ſelf before him.</p>
                  <p>That, God is thus powerfull and wiſe, he goes on to prove in the following parts of the Chapter to the 22. verſe, by the enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of many particular acts and effects, both of his power and wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>The other part of his argument, namely, the conſequent, that therefore <hi>Job</hi> was unjuſt and wicked, he denies, and more, refutes it ſtrongly. His negation and refutation begin at the 22<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe. <hi>This is one thing, therefore I ſaid it, He deſtroyeth the righteous and the wicked.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>This is no argument, that I am a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedman, becauſe God hath deſtroyed my eſtate, and my children; for God (in this ſenſe) deſtroyeth both the righteous and the wicked. It cannot be proved that I am wicked, becauſe God hath afflicted me; or, that God hath afflicted me for my wickedneſſe: I know another way how to acquit the juſtice of God, and to declare him righteous, though I doe not joyn with you in condemning and judging myſelf (in your notion) unrighteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the ſumme of his anſwer contained in the ninth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>In the tenth he renews his complaint, as before in the ſixth, and ſheweth (after he had given God glory under all his ſufferings)

                     <p>So then, it is here a ſealing to the former truth delivered, both by <hi>Bildad</hi> and <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> about the juſtice of God; <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, verſ. 17. and <hi>Bildad</hi> in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, ver. 3. <hi>Doth the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pervert judgement?</hi> No (ſaith <hi>Job) I know it of a truth, that he doth not.</hi> And ſo the ſenſe runs thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bildad, doeſt thou ſurmiſe, by what I have spoken, that I have ill or hard thoughts of the juſtice of God? Did I ever thinke that justice was perverted, becauſe I was afflicted? I acknowledge thou haſt truly ſaid, that God doth not pervert judgement; and I acknowledge thou haſt faithfully counſelled me to ſeek unto God, and make my ſupplication to the Almighty; for alas! who am I that I ſhould contend with God? What am I that I ſhould diſpute it out with him concerning my troubles, and his dealings with me? Or, if I ſhould be ſo raſh, ſo fool-hardy, and adventurous, to attempt ſuch a thing; alas! I could make nothing of it, I could not anſwer him one argument of a thouſand, whereby he might maintain his own juſtice, or to one charge and article of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, whereby he might impeach mine. I am no match for God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I yeeld thee the whole matter, ſo farre as concerns the honouring of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51057:76"/> God in that great Attribute of his justice, and the duty of weak man in humbling himſelf before the great God. I know it to be ſo of a truth.</hi> Note hence,</p>

                        </note> Aſſoon as <hi>Job</hi> hears a truth, he falleth down before it. He hath not a word to ſpeak againſt the truth of God, though it come from erroneous men. He will be a friend to truth, though brought by them who ſeemed his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. If this law of diſputation were well obſerved, many diſputes would be ſooner ended. As ſome out of love to men, are apt to entertain their very errours; ſo ſome out of hatred to men reject their truths. Errours cannot be really adorned, nor truths ſoiled by thoſe who hold them. Our judgement about both muſt be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by reaſon, not ſwaied by affection. Willingly to embrace and receive a truth from thoſe, whoſe errours we moſt zealouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is the due temper of a champion for the truth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>I know it to be ſo of a truth,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A godly man is a knowing man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is eſtabliſhed in truths, eſpecially in great and neceſſary truths, in the vitals and fundamentals of religion. <hi>Job</hi> had been long acquainted with this principle, that God is juſt, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man muſt abaſe himſelf before him, how juſt ſoever any man is. Light is the firſt thing which God makes in the new Creation of Grace, as it was in the old creation of nature: He caſts in a beam, a ray into the ſoul, whereby we may diſcern of things that differ. There may be darkneſſe in a godly man, but he dwels not in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: bring a truth to him, and as there is ſomewhat in his heart that anſwers and is a kin to it, ſo that apprehends and makes out his acquaintance with it, often at firſt light, alwaies after conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, unleſſe he be under clouds and temptations. In thoſe caſes we may bring truths to holy men, which they doe not <hi>know to be ſo of a truth,</hi> yea, which they may refuſe for errours. But uſually a good man knows truth, having learnt it before, or as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a likeneſſe to other truths he knew before.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>I know this to be ſo of a truth</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) in the midſt of his pains, in the greateſt troubles of his fleſh, he forgets not to honour God.</p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:51057:76"/>
                     <p>Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A gracious heart gives teſtimony to the righteouſneſſe of God, though ſeverely chaſtened under the hand of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When God deals moſt hardly with the ſoul or with the body, or with ſoul and body, a holy heart hath not a hard thought of God, <hi>I know it to be ſo of a truth;</hi> He doth not only acknowledge that God was juſt, when he puniſhed others, but when he afflicted him. The common argument which the friends of <hi>Job</hi> took up to prove God to be juſt, was this: God is righteous, for he deals with men according to their deſerts: but <hi>Job</hi> argues thus, God is righteous, however he deals with men, and whatſoever thoſe men are, let men be wicked or upright, holy or prophane. When we ſee God breaking the wicked, and making gall and worm-wood, fire and brimſtone the portion of their cup, this argues his juſtice, becauſe he hath threatned ſuch with wrath and vengeance. But the Saints go further, they proceed upon purer and ſublimer principles, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God is juſt, though he afflict the juſteſt and holieſt man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth. The righteouſneſſe of God ſhines forth to them thorow the darkeſt ſufferings of righteous men. The righteouſnes of God is not grounded upon the object about which he dealeth, whether righteous or unrighteous, but upon the act of his own will, yea upon the pleaſure of his own will. His righteouſneſſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from himſelf, and his is a righteous act, whatever the object be upon which he acts. We need not ſay, God is juſt, becauſe he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the guilty; for God is juſt, though he afflict the innocent. We may at once maintain our own innocency, and the juſtice of God, while we bleed under his hand, or ſmart under his ſevereſt ſcourges. <hi>I know it to be ſo of a truth.</hi>

                        <hi>Broughton</hi> reads, <hi>And how can man be juſt before the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent?</hi> and ſo the ſenſe runs more clear,<note place="margin">Illud cum Deo vel ante Deuma erit aliquid ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renſe &amp; judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciale.</note> taking the firſt particle for a pure copulative, whereas we read it as a <hi>diſcretive, but how ſhall man be juſt before God?</hi> Namely, in your ſenſe; as if he had ſaid, you diſcourſe of juſtice under ſuch a notion as renders it impoſſible for any man to be juſt before God; in one ſenſe a man may be righteous before God, but in yours no man can. Would you not have a man know himſelf to be juſt, unleſſe he know himſelf to be without ſinne? If you take juſt, to be the ſame as without in-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſinne, then it is impoſſible for any man to appear juſt before
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51057:77"/> God: but man may be juſt and righteous before God, though he have ſinne dwelling in him, and that's my notion of juſtice in this diſpute.</p>
                     <p>Juſtice is either inherent or imputed. By inherent juſtice no man is juſt before God: according to imputed juſtice, man may be juſt, and is before God. So theſe two propoſitions are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, <hi>No man is just before God: every believer is juſt before God.</hi> Our tranſlation uſing the diſcretive, <hi>But,</hi> ſeems to carry this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment, that no man can be juſt before God by inherent juſtice, which the next verſe implies, <hi>For if he contend with him, he cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The words taken in this ſenſe are the ſame with the ſeventeenth verſe of the fourth Chapter, <hi>Shall mortall man be more juſt then God?</hi> There <hi>Eliphaz</hi> ſpeaks comparatively, in a way of exceſſe, <hi>more juſt,</hi> or, <hi>just rather then God:</hi> He cannot exceed God in any thing.

But I need not ſtay in any further clearing, how man is not juſt before God, or in any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations from it, but ſhall referre the Reader back to the fourth Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Onely take this from it, <hi>How ſhall man be juſt with God? With God;</hi> that is, looking upon, or comparing himſelf unto God; as if he had ſaid, It will take down all the proud and high thoughts of man, in regard of his own juſtice and righteouſneſſe, if he will but caſt his eye upon God, and duly conſider how juſt and righteous God is.

                        <hi>The way for us to humble our ſelves for our own ſinfulneſſe, is to look up and to conſider the purity and holineſſe of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If we ſet our ſelves before him, we ſhall ſee how vile and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt we are. His fulneſſe will convince us abundantly of our em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptineſſe, his purity will ſhew us our ſpots, and his all-ſufficiency our nothingneſſe. If we bring a courſe peece of cloth before a fine, we ſhall ſee what courſe ſtuff it is: if we lay a better in any kinde by a worſe, the worſe will appear worſer then before. For the moſt part we who are courſe ſtuff our ſelves, compare our ſelves with thoſe who are as courſe as our ſelves. While ſome men compare
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51057:77"/> themſelves with men, they begin to thinke they are like God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. A man looking upon his neighbour is juſt before him, or ſees him no better then himſelf, of no purer threed, of no better die in his life then he; I have faults, and ſo have others; I have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſo have my neighbours; if you charge me with my ſinnings, who is it that is without ſinne?

The Phariſee could pride himſelf in his compariſons with men (<hi>Luk.</hi> 18.) <hi>God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I am not as other men are, nor as this Publican.</hi> But Phariſee, art thou as God? pure, and holy, and juſt as he? <hi>Look upward, and pride will down.</hi> The holy Apoſtle (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12.) ſpeaking of thoſe falſe Apoſtles, ſaith, <hi>They meaſuring themſelves by themſelves, and comparing themſelves amongſt themſelves, are not wiſe.</hi> So we may ſay to men in generall, while ye take a ſcantling of your own waies, by your own rules, and meaſure your ſelves by your ſelves, or while ye meaſure man by man, and compare creature with crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ye are not wiſe; while we go this way to work pride will not down. Man hath ſome reaſon to ſay, I am as good as man, I have ſinned, and ſo hath he, ſuch a man hath as many ſins as I. But if we look up to God, we ſhall quickly finde that he hath no ſinne at all in him, and that we have no goodneſſe at all in us.

                     <q>He cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand.</q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He cannot anſwer.]</hi> Some referre it only to the perſon. <hi>He,</hi> that is, one man of a thouſand men, is not able to anſwer God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We may referre it to the matter, to the objections or charges, that ſhall be brought againſt him, he cannot anſwer to one thing of a thouſand. So M <hi>Broughton;</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>If God brings many charges,</hi> or laies many articles againſt him, he is not able to ſatisfie God, or give a good account in one.</p>

                        </note>Thirdly, Some referre it to God himſelf, <hi>If he,</hi> (that is, man) <hi>ſhould contend with him, he would not anſwer him one of a thouſand,</hi> that is, God would not anſwer him one of a thouſand: as if he had ſaid, the matters will be ſo triviall and ſo ſleight, the charges that a man can bring againſt God, or the objections he can make will be ſo eaſie, that the Lord will not vouchſafe to anſwer one word of a thouſand. Some men will plead priviledge to ſome charges, and all their anſwer ſhall be, they may chuſe, or it is at their liberty whether they will anſwer or no. Here <hi>he would not</hi> (referred to God) is as much as he needs not, he is no way obliged to anſwer, he may claim priviledge. Further, when arguments are poor and empty, a man will ſay in diſpute, <hi>Theſe things are not worth anſwering;</hi> or of a book, there is not one page that is worth a confutation, it carries its own confutation. Such a ſenſe may be made out here, God will not diſhonour himſelf by contending with ſo weak an adverſary as man, or by anſwering ſuch ſimple ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Rogatus homo in judicio divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, haeſitabit, ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuabit obmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſcet.</note>But rather (as before) referre it to man, <hi>He cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand;</hi> that is, if God come to queſtion man, to lay ſuch and ſuch matters to his charge, or object againſt him, <hi>poor creature,</hi> he muſt ſhut his mouth, put up his books, he hath nothing to ſay, he muſt hide his face, for he cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand. So in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of this Chapter. <hi>How much leſſe ſhall I anſwer him, and chuſe out my words to plead with him?</hi> Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That there is in man a ſpirit ready to contend againſt God himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If he contend with him,</hi> or, <hi>if he plead with him,</hi> which ſuppoſes
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51057:79"/> that there is ſuch a principle of pride in the heart of man. The heart of man is very full of quarrels and contentions with man, but fuller of quarrels with God himſelf. The great controverſie between God and man, is, whoſe will ſhall ſtand, Gods will or mans. God directs man one way, and man contendeth he will go another way. There is a natural unanſwerablenes between the heart of man, &amp; every thing that God doth or ſpeaks; hence it is that man cals God ſo often to anſwer. There is a contention, firſt, about that work of God, the foundation-ſtone of all the works of God, his decrees and counſels. While the Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20.) ſtops ſuch mouths, he ſhews how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they are to open, <hi>O man, Who art thou that replieſt against God? Thou wilt ſay, wherefore doth he complain?</hi> Thus man begins to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. But, O man, who art thou, that thou ſhouldeſt dare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply upon God? Wilt thou be venturing to queſtion the righteous God? Muſt he be accountable to thee for what he did before thou hadſt a being?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, What contentions are there continually about the rules which God gives man to order his life by? Man thinks this is an unreaſonable rule, that's a hard rule, and a third is an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table rule; how many riſe up againſt the Law, to which they ſhould ſubmit, and would ſhift off obedience to the rule, by complaints againſt it? <hi>The carnall minde</hi> (or, <hi>the minding of the fleſh) is enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against God, it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be</hi> (Rom. 8.7.) Words importing higheſt oppoſition, and that, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconciliable. It is not, it cannot be ſubject; the minde is never ſubject to the Law, till it be changed into the Law. Chriſt ſaith, that one iota or title of the Law ſhall not paſſe, till all be fulfilled; it is as true, that not one iota or title of the Law can be fulfilled by us, till our carnall mindes paſſe away. <hi>Paul</hi> found juſt as much ſtubbornneſſe and contrariety againſt the will of God remaining in him, as there was of a carnall minde remaining in him (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.) As man deſires not the knowledge of the will of God (<hi>Job</hi> 21.14.) and ſecretly wiſhes that he were ignorant of what he knows, ſo he wiſhes there were no ſuch thing to be known; and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will of God were leſſe by ſo much, as it ſpecially oppoſeth his will.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The conteſt about providence grows as high in the hearts of men, as that about predeſtination to life, or the rule of life. The Saints ſometimes (modeſtly) enter this controverſie, <hi>Let me plead with thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Chap. 12.1. <hi>He</hi> doth it, we ſee,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51057:80"/> with a great deal of trembling and ſubmiſſion; he ſeems to ask leave before he doth it. Hypocrites contend with God proudly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their own good works, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3.) <hi>Wherefore have we faſted, and thou ſeest not?</hi> As if they had done ſo well, that God himſelf could not mend it. Carnall men plead with God profanely about his works; as if he had done ſo ill, that they could mend it. <hi>Ye ſay, the way of the Lord is not equall: hear now, O houſe of Iſrael, is not my way equall? Are not your waies unequall,</hi> Ezek. 18.25. They charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God with ill dealing, becauſe he puniſhed them, who did evil. <hi>Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have tranſgreſſed againſt me, ſaith the Lord</hi> (Jer. 2.29.) they began to plead with God about his diſpenſations, as if he had been unrighteous or rigorous; <hi>Wherefore will ye plead with me? I will plead with you, ſaith God,</hi> verſ. 9. God may plead and contend with man, but ſhall man plead and contend with God? Ye have all ſinned and tranſgreſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; that's enough to ſtop your mouths; I can anſwer you with one word, <hi>Ye are a company of ſinners,</hi> then plead not with me. <hi>Plead with your mother, plead,</hi> Hoſ. 2.2. let man plead with man, man with his neighbour. The wit of one man may compare with the wit of another, and their juſtice may hold plea with one another. But neither the juſtice, nor the wit of man will ſerve him to plead with God. That is a ſecond obſervation,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Man is not able to maintain his cauſe, and hold plea, either against the works of God, or for his own.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If he diſpute with God in the ſchools, or fee an advocate to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead him at the barre, he is not able to anſwer him <hi>one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi> (Iſa. 45.9.) <hi>Woe be to him that ſtriveth with his maker;</hi> it is this word, <hi>Wee be to him that contendeth with his maker,</hi> for he ſhall not be able to make out one argument, or prove any thing againſt him; ſuch a man is in a very ſad condition, woe unto him. <hi>David</hi> praies, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 143.2. <hi>Enter not into judgement with thy ſervant for in thy ſight ſhall no fleſh living be juſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ed;</hi> As if he had ſaid, Lord, if the holieſt and pureſt, if the beſt of men ſhould come and ſtand before thee in judgement, or plead with thee, they could not be juſtified: therefore <hi>David</hi> was ſo farre from contending with God, that he deprecates Gods contending with him, enter not into judgement with thy ſervant: ſuch a charge is laid upon <hi>Job</hi> (Chap. 33.13.) <hi>Why doſt thou ſtrive with him? for he giveth not an account of any of his matters.</hi> And if he ſhould condeſcend to give an account, can any man gain by it? The Lord argues ſo convincingly, <hi>That every mouth muſt be ſtopped, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51057:80"/> all the world become guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3.19. Every mouth ſhall be ſtopped, when God opens his. When God ſpeaks, man hath nothing to ſay againſt him, <hi>Every mouth is ſtopped,</hi> with this one word, <hi>Man is a ſinner.</hi> The Apoſtle points at ſome (Tit. 1.11.) <hi>Whoſe mouths muſt be ſtopped,</hi> he means, with reaſon to convince them that they are in an errour. By this one argument, <hi>That all men are ſinners,</hi> God ſtops their mouths forever.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By way of corallary, we may give you that generall ttuth,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That no man can be juſtified by his works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If we contend with him, we cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand.</hi> He that mixeth but one ſin with a thouſand good actions, cannot be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by his works; how then ſhall he be juſtified by works, who hath not one perfectly good action amongſt a thouſand ſins? Man is not able to anſwer for one thing he doth of a thouſand, no not for one thing he doth of all that he hath done. He that would be juſtified by his works muſt not have one ill action amongſt all his actions. One flie in the box of ointment corrupts all; one defect makes a ſinner, but many good actions cannot make one righteous, <hi>If our heart condemn us, God is greater then our heart</hi> (1 Joh. 3.20.) Should man contend with his own heart, that will condemn him, his own heart would bring a thouſand witneſſes againſt him ſooner then one for him. <hi>Conſcience is a thouſand witneſſes;</hi> man cannot anſwer before that tribunall; how much leſſe can he anſwer God, <hi>Who is greater then our hearts, and knoweth all things!</hi> That's the argument <hi>Job</hi> goes on with, to prove that man cannot be juſtified before God.</p>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51057:81"/> in a due poiſe, <hi>He is wiſe in heart and mighty in power,</hi> therefore there is no turning of him out of the path of juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is a proof or a confirmation of the other point a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which <hi>Bildad</hi> adviſeth <hi>Iob,</hi> namely, that he ought to ſeek un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and humble himſelf before him, it would be dangerous to contend or conteſt with God.

Alas! man is no match for God, <hi>He is wiſe in heart and mighty in ſtrength,</hi> who can enter ſuch a controverſie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in it?</p>
                     <p>There are two waies to carry on a controverſie.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By wit and policy.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By ſtrength and power. If man will take up the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer weapon againſt God, if he work by wit and diſpute againſt God, God will be too hard for him, <hi>For he is wiſe in heart.</hi> If man will ſet his ſhoulders, or take up weapons againſt God, poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what can he doe? <hi>The Lord is mighty in ſtrength;</hi> from both we ſee there is no dealing with him.</p>

Hence obſerve,</p>

                        <hi>God is infinitely wiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He is wiſe in heart,</hi> wiſdom it ſelf. The Lord ingroſſes all wiſdom, and is therefore ſtiled by the Apoſtle, <hi>God only wiſe</hi> (1 Tim. 1.17.) he is only wiſe, becauſe all wiſdome is his; the creature hath none but what he gives out; he hath it all locked up in his own treaſury, and as he diſpenſeth it, ſo man receives it.</p>
                     <p>There is a two-fold act of wiſdome, and both moſt eminent in God. The firſt is, knowledge in the nature of things. The ſecond is, knowledge how to order and diſpoſe of things. The former is properly called <hi>Science;</hi> and the later, <hi>prudence.</hi> Where there is much of the former, and a want of the later, man in that caſe is like a ſhip that hath a very large ſail, but wants a rudder to order it's courſe, and ballaſt to poiſe it. Both theſe meet in the Lord: he hath (as we may ſay) a vaſt ſail, infinitely extending to the knowledge of all things: and he hath a moſt exact rudder, and ballaſt of prudence, to order and to manage all things. The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſome men is too hard for their wiſdome, they are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of their knowledge, though they may be maſters in their art. The Lord knows all, and he rules all his knowledge.</p>
                     <q>And mighty in ſtrength.</q>

                     <p>The word which we tranſlate <hi>ſtrength</hi> (referred to man) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that naturall power and lively vigour which in man is the principle of ſtrength, which nurſes and feeds man with continuall ſupplies of activity. The Lord is mighty in this ſtrength, he hath an infinite, an everlaſting ſpring of ſtrength in him, he ſpends no
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51057:82"/> ſtrength at all, how much ſoever he uſes. His lamp conſumes not with burning. His ſtrength is ever vigorous, he knows no decaies or faintings, <hi>Haſt thou not known, hast thou not heard that the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting God, the Lord, the Creatour of the ends of the earth fainteth not, neither is weary?</hi> (Iſa. 40.28.) As if he had ſaid, where haſt thou been bred, that thou ſeemeſt to be a ſtranger to this truth? Man cannot doe much, and he faints in doing a little. God who can doe all things, never faints, how much ſoever he doth.</p>
                     <p>Strength maybe conſidered two waies. There is civill ſtrength, and there is naturall ſtrength. Civill ſtrength is authority and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to command.<note place="margin">

Naturall ſtrength executes and exerciſes the former; a man may have much civill ſtrength, but if he want naturall ſtrength, to put it in act, he can do little or nothing. As God by his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty is above all creatures; ſo by his power he is able to bring all creatures under him, and ſubdue them to his command. Thus God is <hi>mighty in ſtrength.</hi> He hath a right of authority, by which he may, and an arm of power, by which he can make all ſtoop to him. Hence obſerve,</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>There is nothing too hard for the Lord, <hi>If he will work, who ſhall let it?</hi> Iſa. 43.13. No creature can <hi>ſuperſedeat</hi> or ſtay the works of God, God can <hi>ſuperſedeat</hi> all creatures; when creatures are in their full carreer, he can let them: <hi>The power of God is as large as his will;</hi> yea he can doe more then he wils. If the power of men were as large as their wils, what work would they quickly make in the world? If infinite ſtrength were not mannaged by infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, what a wofull condition were we in? Both theſe are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in God. Therefore we can fear no hurt from his power: he can doe what he will, but he will doe nothing which is hurtfull to his people; he will not wrong any creature, much leſſe his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. The Lord (if I may ſo ſpeak) is only weak about thoſe things, which proceed from weakneſſe. There are ſome things which he hath no ſtrength to doe, becauſe to doe them ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a want of ſtrength: he cannot deny himſelf, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie, he cannot doe any evil, he cannot ſinne. Theſe things
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51057:82"/> import impotency, therefore the Lord cannot doe them. But whatſoever is for the good of his people, for the glory of his name, for the executing of his juſtice, for the fulfilling of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, whatſoever is for the making good of his promiſes, for all theſe the Lord is mighty in ſtrength.<note place="margin">Vis confilij ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers mole ruit ſua.</note> Never fear either a defect of power in God, or a defect in mannaging that power.

Thus it is with God (and how admirable is the union and marriage of theſe two together!) he hath all power and all wiſdome. Every degree of power in God is acted with a ſutable degree of wiſdome; therefore there can be no miſcarriage.</p>
                     <p>Note further, how this Attribute runs thorow all the Attributes of God, <hi>He is mighty in ſtrength;</hi> he is mighty alſo in truth, mighty in love, mighty in mercy, mighty in faithfulneſſe: a mighty ſtrength is in whatſoever God is.</p>
                     <p>Again, Take this generall concerning all the Attributes of God, when it is ſaid, <hi>He is wiſe in heart and mighty in ſtrength</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are not qualities in God; they are in men. Wiſdome is to them an accident, and ſo is ſtrength, whether civill ſtrength or naturall, it may be ſevered from them, and they ſtill keep their being. But the wiſdome of God is the wiſe God, and the power of God is the powerfull God, and the knowledge of God is the knowing God. Theſe Attributes are not accidents, but his eſſence, not qualities, but his nature.</p>
                     <p>From both theſe Attributes laid together, <hi>Job</hi> draws down his great concluſion, which he puts by way of queſtion.</p>

                     <p>In a morall ſenſe, to harden is to ſettle the ſpirit, or immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to reſolve upon the doing or not doing of a thing: when a man doth purpoſely reſolve and reſolvedly purpoſe to carry on a deſign, he hardeneth himſelf to doe it. The word is uſed both in a good ſenſe and in an ill ſenſe. In a good ſenſe, when a man is reſolute to do the will of God, that is, when he grows ſo reſolved, that he will not be removed by hopes or fears, by promiſes or by threats; When a man hath not a ſoft, ſequacious ſpirit to be ſwaied this way and that way, but ſtands fixed and firm like a rock, ſuch a reſolute ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in goodneſſe, is a ſpirit hardened to doe good.</p>
                     <p>When the Lord had told <hi>Ezekiel</hi> that he ſhould finde the ears of <hi>Iſrael</hi> lock'd againſt his meſſages, and their hearts hardened; he gives him aſſurance of a ſutable ability to deal even with ſuch (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.8, 9.) <hi>Behold, I have made thy face ſtrong against their faces, and thy fore-head ſtrong againſt their fore-heads, as an adamant harder then flint have I made thy fore-head.</hi> The words ſeem to carry an alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Buls or Rams, who uſe to run head againſt head, when they are enraged againſt one another. And ſo the ſenſe is, as if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>I know this people will be mad at thee, and runne upon thee like furious beaſts; but trouble not thy ſelf, I will (through my grace) make thee as ſtrong in declaring my will, as they (through pride and unbelief) are ſtrong in oppoſing it. Thou needeſt not fear to encounter theſe Buls and Rams: holineſſe ſhall make thy fore-head, that is, thy purpoſe to performe my command, harder, then wickedneſſe ſhall make their fore-heads, that is, their purpoſes to diſobey what I command.</hi> As to be hardened in ſinne is worſe then ſinning, ſo to be hardened in doing good is better then doing good.

                     <p>Firſt, A reſolving to ſin, whatſoever God ſaith or doth.<note place="margin">Obdurare cor eſt Deum loquente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nolle audire, contemnere, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicaciter reſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtere, nec ſe ejus verbo ſubjicere velle <hi>Par.</hi> in Heb. c. <hi>3.</hi> v. <hi>8.</hi>
                        </note> To ſin againſt the word and works of God, that's hardening of the heart againſt God: when a man will go on in his way, though a threat be ſounding in his ears, &amp; a judgment appear terribly before his eyes; ſuch a man is hardned indeed, he is grown valiant and couragious in wickednes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A man hardens himſelf againſt God, when he ſpeaks ſtoutly againſt God: the hardneſſe of the heart appears in the tongue (Mal. 3.13.) <hi>Your words have been ſtout againſt me.</hi> Stout words are a ſign of ſtout ſpirits. Our language is uſually the image of our mindes. So the word of the text is uſed (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.43.) <hi>The words of the men of Judah were fiercer then the words of the men of Iſrael:</hi> Their words were harder then the words of the men of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> they ſpake more reſolutely and manly. When a man ſets himſelf to ſpeak boldly againſt God, the waies or the works of God, he hardens himſelf againſt God fearfully.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, We harden our ſelves againſt God when we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſed with what God doth; That man makes a bold adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who dares paſſe but an unpleaſing thought againſt the waies or works of God.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Not to be ſatisfied with what God doth, is a degree of hardening our ſelves againſt God: diſcontents and unquietneſſes upon our ſpirits are oppoſitions.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, Not to give God glory in what he doth, hath ſomewhat in it of hardening of our ſelves againſt God.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, He that will not give God glory in what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, is in a degree hardened againſt God. We may ſee what it is to harden our ſelves againſt God by the oppoſite of it (<hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14.) <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alwaies, but he that hardeneth himſelf ſhall fall into miſchief.</hi> Hardneſſe is contrary to holy fear; holy fear is a diſpoſition of heart ready to yeeld to God in every thing: A man thus fearing, quickly takes impreſſions of the word, will and works of God; and therefore whoſoever doth not comply with God in holy ſubmiſſion to his will, hardens himſelf in part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</p>
                     <p>That which is here chiefly meant is, the groſſer act of hardneſſe, when men either ſpeak or go on in their way acting againſt God; let
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51057:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> him ſay what he will, his word ſtops them not; or do what he will, his works ſtop them not. They are like the adamant, the hammer of the Word makes no impreſſion upon hard hearts, but recoyls back again upon him that ſtrikes with it. More diſtinctly; this is either a ſenſible hardneſſe of heart, of which the Church complains (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.15.) <hi>Wherefore haſt thou hardened our hearts?</hi> &amp;c. or an inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hardneſſe, which in ſome ariſes from ignorance, in others from malice and obſtinacy.</p>
                     <p>Further, We read of Gods hardening mans heart, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of mans hardening his own heart. There is a three-fold hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Naturall, which is the common ſtock of all men; we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſtone of a hard heart by deſcent; every man comes into the world hardened againſt God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is an acquired hardneſſe of heart. Men har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den themſelves, and adde to their former hardneſſe. <hi>He ſtretcheth out his hand againſt God, and ſtrengtheneth himſelf against the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,</hi> Job 15.25. There is a growth in ſin, as well as a growth in grace, many acts make hardneſſe more habituall (2 Chron. 36.13.) <hi>He ſtiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Lord. I know thy rebellion, and thy ſtiffe necke,</hi> Deut. 31.27.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is a judiciary hardneſſe of heart, an hard heart inflicted by God, as a Judge. When men will harden their hearts againſt God, he agrees it, their hearts ſhall be hard, he will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the means which ſhould ſoften and moiſten them, he will not give them any help to make them pliable to his will, or he will not bleſſe it to them. He will ſpeak to his Prophets, and they ſhall make their hearts fat (that is, ſenſleſſe) and their ears heavy, that is, heedleſſe under all they ſpeak, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.10. Thus alſo God hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the heart of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> by the miniſtery of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So then we having hardneſſe of heart by nature, doe by cuſtome acquire a further hardneſſe, and the Lord in wrath inflicteth hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then the ſinner is pertinacious in ſinning. All theſe put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make him irrecoverably ſinfull, <hi>His neck is an iron ſinew, and his brow braſſe,</hi> Iſa. 48.4.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve, firſt, <hi>There is an active hardneſſe of heart, or man hardens his own heart.</hi> Exod. 5. We read of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hardening his heart, before the Lord hardened it; <hi>Who is the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51057:84"/> ſhould let Iſrael goe?</hi> Here was <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hardening his heart, and ſteeling his ſpirit againſt the command of God, God ſent him a command to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> goe; he replies, <hi>Who is the Lord? I know not the Lord;</hi> who is this that takes upon him to command me? Am not I King of <hi>Aegypt?</hi> I know no Peer, much leſſe Superiour Lord. It was true indeed, poor creature! he did not know the Lord; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſpake right in that, <hi>I know not the Lord;</hi> if he had, he would never have ſaid, I will not let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, he would have let all goe at his command, had he known who the Lord was that commanded. Thus <hi>Sennacherib</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.14.) blaſphemes by his meſſengers, <hi>Who was there among all the gods of thoſe Nations that my fathers utterly deſtroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God ſhould be able to deliver you out of mine hand?</hi> Theſe are hard words againſt God, and hardening words to man.</p>
                     <p>Every act of ſinne hardens the heart of man, but the heat of blaſphemy at once ſhews and puts it into the extremity of hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Man hardens himſelf againſt God four waies eſpecially.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Upon preſumption of mercy; many doe evil, becauſe they hear God is good; they turn his grace into wantonneſſe, and are without all fear of the Lord, becauſe there is mercy ſo much with the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The patience of God or his delaies of judgement harden others, becauſe God is ſlow to ſtrike, they are ſwift to ſin. If the ſound of judgment be not at the heels of ſin, they conclude, there is no ſuch danger in ſin; <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved this (Eccleſ. 8.11.) <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to doe evil,</hi> or, <hi>it is full in them to doe evil.</hi> They have not ſome velleities and propenſions, ſome moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and inclinations, ſome queries and debates about it, but the matter (upon this ground) is fully ſtated and determined, they are ſo full of it, that they have no room in their hearts for better thoughts or counſels: the ſumme of all is, they are hardened and reſolved to doe evil.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Groſſe ignorance hardens many, 1. Ignorance of themſelves. And, 2. Ignorance of God: he that knows not what he ought to doe, cares not much what he doth. None are ſo ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous as they, who know not their danger. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid, <hi>I know not the Lord,</hi> he knew not the Lord, nor himſelf, therefore he ran on blinde-fold, and deſperately hardened himſelf againſt the Lord.</p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:51057:85"/>
                     <p>Fourthly, Hardneſſe of heart in ſinning is contracted from the multitude of thoſe who ſinne. They thinke none ſhall ſuffer for that which ſo many doe. The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to doe evil</hi> (Exod. 23.2.) There is a ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon it, becauſe man is ſo eaſily led by many. The heart is ready to flatter it ſelf into an opinion, that God will not be very angry, when a practice is grown common: this is the courſe of the world, this is the way of moſt men; therefore ſurely no great danger in it. And examples harden chiefly upon three conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
                     <p>

                        </note>Firſt, If great ones go that way; the Heathen brings in a young man, who hearing of the adulteries and wickedneſſes of the gods; ſaid, what? Doe they ſo, <hi>and ſhall I ſtick at it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, If ſome wiſe and learned men go that way, ignorant and unlearned men conclude they may.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, If any godly men, ſuch as make more then ordinary profeſſion, doe ſuch things, then who may not? The failings of the Saints are a countenance to wicked men in their follies. They are apt to follow the dark ſide of the cloud, and to approve thoſe in what they doe ill, whom they ſcorn in what they doe well. They imitate their fals and ſins, whoſe repentance they never thinke of imitating. How many harden their hearts by their doing what is evil, whoſe hearts have been broken, becauſe they did evil? From the ſinne which a holy man commits againſt his purpoſe and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, many purpoſe and reſolve to commit it.</p>
                     <p>Upon theſe and the like grounds, the heart of man is hardened againſt God. Take a brief of the degrees of this hardneſſe; ſee by what ſteps the heart riſes ſo high in ſinning. Man doth not grow hard at once, much leſſe hardeſt. But w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>n once he begins to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en himſelf, where he ſhall make an end he knows not.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſtep is, the taking time and leave to meditate upon ſinne, and roll it up and down in the thoughts. A hard heart lets vain thoughts dwell in it. A holy heart would not let them lodge with it.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond ſtep is, ſome taſtes of pleaſure and delight in ſinne. It proves a ſweet morſell under his tongue. As the heart grows more delighted in ſinne, ſo more hardened in ſinne. Nothing ſhould be ſo bitter as ſinne in the act, for nothing will be ſo bitter as ſinne in the iſſue: but when the act is pleaſant, the iſſue is ſeldome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected.</p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:51057:85"/>
                     <p>The third ſtep is, cuſtome in ſinning. It argues great boldneſſe to venture often. One ſaid of him that had eſcaped danger at ſea,<note place="margin">Improbè Neptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num accuſat, qui iterum nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragium ſacit.</note> If you go again, you have no reaſon to complain, though you be wrack'd. Mariners are fearfull of ſtorms at firſt, but through cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome they play with them. When a man comes ofs once ſafe from ſinne, he will venture again, and ſo often, till at laſt he thinks there is ſcarce any venture at all in ſinne. He growes bold and hardy.</p>
                     <p>By the fourth ſtep of hardneſſe he comes to defend and maintain his ſinne. He hath ſpoken ſo long in his heart againſt the word, which forbiddeth him to ſin, that now he can ſpeak againſt it with his tongue. He hath a plea or an argument to make the evil he doth good. He appears a Patron, an Advocate for ſin, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but a practiſer of it.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The hard heart grows angry and paſſionate with thoſe, who give advice againſt ſin; he is reſolved, and a man that is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his way, is angry if he be deſired to remove out of his way: He that is reſolved to ſleep, loves not to be awakened. A touch or a jog from him that ſits by, provokes him, he praies to be let alone. We ſhould love the man while we hate and reprove his ſin. But he that loves his ſin will hate his reprovers.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Hard hearts grow too hard for the Word, they are <hi>Sermon-proof;</hi> they can ſit under the Preacher, and hear from day to day, but nothing touches them. A man in armour feels not the ſtroak of a ſword, much leſſe the ſmart of a rod. This hardneſſe of heart is a ſteel armour to the heart; it makes the man paſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till he be paſt healing. <hi>Some being often reproved hurden their hearts</hi> (Prov. 29.1.) till their hearts are too hard for all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes.</p>
                     <p>And then ſeventhly, The heart is ſo hard that the ſword of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doth not pierce it, the man is <hi>judgement-proof:</hi> let God ſtrike him in his perſon or eſtate, let God ſet the world a fire about his ears, yet on goes he. He is like the man of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 23.34.) who lies ſleeping in a ſtorm upon the top of a maſt.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, The hard heart ſits down in the chair of the ſcorner, he derides the Word, and mocks at the judgements of God. When <hi>Lot</hi> ſpake to his ſons in law about fire and brimſtone, ready to fall upon <hi>Sodome</hi> and conſume it, the text ſaith, <hi>He ſeemed as one that mocked unto his ſonnes in Law?</hi> what, tell us of judgements? of fire
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51057:86"/> deſcending from Heaven. <hi>When the skie falls we ſhall have Larkes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The hard heart gets up to the tribunall of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and from ſcorner <hi>commences oppoſer of good men,</hi> and <hi>of the good waies of God;</hi> he will doe them the uttermoſt miſchief he can, who would doe him all the good they can. <hi>Get thee from me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 10.28.) <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf: See my face no more; for in the day that thou ſeeſt my face thou ſhalt die. Pharaohs</hi> hard heart ſpake hard words, and was preparing to give hard blows: he had only ſo much of honour and ingenuity left, as to warn the Prophet to avoid the blow. Which yet is more then hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart leaves to all. Many an hard heart uſes the hand before the tongue; and in ſtead of ſaying to his reprover, See my face no more, leſt thou die, cals him before his face, that he may die, or ſeek his death behinde his back, and lies in wait for revenge. And here <hi>hardneſſe of heart is at hardeſt. It is now a fit cuſhion for Satan: He ſits ſofteſt upon this ſtone;</hi> The devil is never ſo much pleaſed, as when man is moſt hardened; the ſeed of his temptations takes root and proſpers beſt in this ſtony ground.</p>
                     <p>But ſhall man proſper too? Shall any man thrive or make a gain by hardening himſelf againſt God? Shall he come off with honour or with profit? <hi>Job</hi> anſwereth, <hi>Who hath hardened himſelf againſt him, and hath proſpered?</hi> Which may be reſolved into this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative propoſition,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Firſt, No pertinacious hard hearted man could ever glory that he got the better, or the day of God, and ſo proſpered into a peace by warre; that's a way of proſperity, in which he ſhall never tread. <hi>Gideon</hi> told the men of <hi>Penuel, When I come again in peace;</hi> that is, when I have conquered and return proſperous, then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No man ever conquered God, and ſo returned in peace.

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Who ever hardened himſelf againſt God and proſpered?</hi> That is, did ever any man ſo weary out God by lengthening this

Did ever any one put the Lord to offer a treaty with articles of peace, to ſave himſelf from further trouble? They who have not ſtrength enough to overcome, may yet have power enough to vex and weary their adverſary. But God can neither be vanquiſh'd by force, nor vext with our policies into a peace with man.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Others give this ſenſe, Who ever held out, or was able to perſiſt in a war againſt the Lord? The wicked ſhall not ſtand before God in the day of judgement, much leſſe in the day of battell; <hi>Who would ſet the bryars and thorns againſt me in battell? I would go thorow them, I would burn them together</hi> (Iſa. 27.4.) The moſt ſteely and and flinty ſpirits in the world can no more ſtand before God, then briars and thorns can before a flaming fire. The Lord ſoon breaks and deſtroies all oppoſing power. And ſo there is a figure in the words, for, man doth not only not proſper, but he is undone and cruſht for ever, by contending with God. Shall man proſper in a warre with God? No, it ſhall end in his own ruine and utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Whence obſerve,</p>

                        <hi>Pharaoh</hi> contended with him, but did he proſper in it? You ſee what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of him at laſt, he was drown'd in the red ſea. <hi>Julian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Chriſt, he ſcoffed at him, (he came up to the higheſt degrees, he ſate in the chair of the ſcorner, and in the tribunall of the perſecutour) but what got he at laſt? When he was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and threw up his bloud toward heaven, ſaid he not? <hi>O Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean, thou haſt overcome:</hi> I acknowledge thy power, whoſe name and truth I have oppoſed. Chriſt whom he had derided, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom he hardened himſelf into ſcorns and ſcoffs, was too hard for him. All that harden themſelves againſt God ſhall be worſted. <hi>Gather your ſelves together, O ye people, and ye ſhall be broken in peeces</hi> (Iſa. 8.9.) Gather your ſelves together: againſt whom? Gather your ſelves together againſt the people of God, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces; Why? <hi>Emanuel,</hi> the Lord is with us. If no man can proſper by hardening himſelf againſt the people of God, becauſe the Lord is with them, how ſhall any man
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51057:87"/> proſper by hardening himſelf immediately <hi>against God?</hi> If <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> will not let any proſper againſt his people, certainly he will not let any proſper againſt himſelf. Therefore (<hi>Prov.</hi> 28.24.) <hi>Solomon</hi> laies it down directly, <hi>He that hardeneth his heart ſhall fall into miſchief;</hi> and (Prov. 29.1.) <hi>He ſhall be destroyed, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy;</hi> there is no help for it, all the world cannot ſave him. A hard heart is it ſelf the foreſt of all judgements, and it brings all judgements upon us. <hi>A hard heart treaſureth up wrath againſt the day of wrath</hi> (Rom. 2.5.) <hi>As a hard heart is Satans treaſury for ſinne: ſo it is Gods treaſury for wrath.</hi> The wals of that <hi>fiery To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> are built up with theſe ſtones, with their hard hearts, who turn themſelves into ſtones againſt the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Then take heed of hardening your ſelves againſt God. You know the counſell which <hi>Gamaliel</hi> gave, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.39. <hi>Refrain from theſe men, and let them alone,</hi> &amp;c. (See how tremblingly he ſpeaks) <hi>leſt you be found even to fight againſt God;</hi> as if he had ſaid, take heed what you doe, it is the moſt dreadfull thing in the world to contend with God; he ſpeaks as of a thing he would not have them come near, or be in the remoteſt tendency to. Man will not meddle with a mortall man, if he be too hard for him: how ſhould we tremble to meddle or contend with the immortall God! Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. warning his Diſciples to <hi>conſider afore-hand what it is to be his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> gives them an inſtance of a King: <hi>What King</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make warre againſt another King, ſitteth not down firſt and conſulteth, whether he be able with ten thouſand, to meet him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth againſt him with twenty thouſand?</hi> Now, I ſay to you (if any ſuch be here) that have hearts ſteel'd or harden'd againſt God, who challenge God the field, and ſend defiance to heaven, O ſit down, ſit down, conſider whether you with your ten thouſand, are able to meet God with his twenty thouſand, that's great odds, half in half; but conſider whether one ſingle, ſimple man can ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his twenty thouſand; whether a man of no ſtrength can ſtand againſt infinite ſtrength; whether you who have no wiſdom, are able to ſtand againſt him that is of infinite wiſdome. Can ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance contend with knowledge, folly with wiſdome, weakneſſe with ſtrength, an earthen veſſel with an iron rod? O the boldneſſe and madneſſe of men, who will hazard themſelves upon ſuch diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. <hi>He is wiſe in heart, and mighty in power, who hath hardened himſelf againſt him, and hath prospered?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as God is ſo powerfull that no wicked man in the world
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51057:87"/> can mend himſelf by contending with him: ſo neither can any of his own people. If they harden themſelves againſt God, they ſhall not proſper. To harden the heart againſt God, is not only the ſin of a <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> of a <hi>Senacherib,</hi> and of a <hi>Julian,</hi> but poſſibly it may be the ſin of a <hi>believer,</hi> the ſin of a <hi>Saint.</hi> And therfore the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. gives them caution, <hi>Take heed lest any of your hearts be hardened through the deceitfulneſſe of ſin;</hi> and whoſe heart ſoever is hardned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>God,</hi> that man good or bad ſhall not proſper, or have peace in it. It is mercy that God will not give his own peace, or let them thrive in ſin. Grace proſpers not, when the heart is hardened; joy proſpers not, nor comfort, nor ſtrength, when the heart is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: the whole ſtate and ſtock of a <hi>beleever</hi> is impaired, when his heart is hardened.</p>
                     <p>And if the Saints harden their heart againſt God, God (in a ſenſe) will harden his heart againſt them; that is, he will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear tender hearted, and compaſſionate towards them, in reference to preſent comforts; he will harden himſelf to afflict and chaſten, when they harden themſelves to ſin and provoke.</p>
                     <p>When God afflicts his people, he hardens his heart againſt them; and it is ſeldome that he hardeneth his heart againſt them, till they harden their hearts againſt him. And the truth is, if they who are deareſt to him do harden their hearts againſt him; if they quarrell and contend with him; if they riſe up againſt his commands, or neglect his will, he will make their hearts ſubmit, or he will make their hearts ake, and break their bones. If they harden their hearts againſt his fear, they ſhall feel his rod upon their backs and ſpirits too. Which of the Saints <hi>ever hardened himſelf againſt God, and hath proſpered?</hi> No man, whether holy or prophane, righteous or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, could ever glory of a conqueſt over God, or triumph after a war with him.</p>

                  <p>The Argument may be thus formed;
<q>
                        <p>He is infinite in power and wiſdome, who removeth moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and ſhakes the earth, who commands the Sunne, who ſpreads out the heavens, and diſpoſeth of the ſtarres in the firmament.</p>
                        <p>But the Lord doth all theſe things, he removeth mountains, he ſhakes the earth, he commandeth the Sun <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore he is mighty in power, and infinite in wiſdome.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt part of this argument is here implied. The aſſumption,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51057:88"/> or the minor, is proved in the 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. verſes, by ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Here then is an evident demonſtration of the power of God from viſible things, from acts apparent to the eye; As if he had ſaid, <hi>If you have not faith to beleeve that God is infinite in power, let your ſenſes teach it you, for he removeth mountains, and they know it not, He overturneth them in his anger,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

A faith removing mountains, is put for the ſtrongeſt faith, <hi>Though I had all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains</hi> (1 Cor. 13.2.) that is, though I had the ſtrongeſt faith, the faith of miracles. When Chriſt (<hi>Mat.</hi> 21.21.) would ſhew to the utmoſt what faith can doe, he faith, <hi>If ye have faith and doubt not, ye ſhall not only doe this which is done to the fig-tree, but alſo, if ye ſhall ſay to this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the ſea, and it ſhall be done.</hi> As if he had ſaid, if you have faith, ye may doe the greateſt things imaginable or deſirable, ye ſhall remove mountains. A mountain is immovable by the meer power of a creature. Faith takes that in hand, becauſe faith acts in the power of the Creatour.

                     <p>So then, taking this ſpeech either for the removing of naturall mountains, or taking it proverbially, as it noteth the doing of the greateſt things, and putting forth of the greateſt power, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the point, which <hi>Job</hi> hath here in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>God is

                        <hi>cap.</hi> 11. mentions the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of a mountain; and <hi>Pliny</hi> in the eighth book of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Hiſtory, <hi>Cap.</hi> 30. A later writer reports that in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> in the year, 1230. there were mountains ſeen moving, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw many houſes, to the great terrour of all the inhabitants of thoſe countries. <hi>Joſephus</hi> alſo reports the like done by an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. And another tels us of Mount <hi>Oſſa</hi> joyned to <hi>Olympus</hi> by an earth-quake. So that take it in the letter, the Lord is able to remove mountains.</p>
                     <p>It ſhould make us fear before the Lord, and give him glory while we remember that even the outward frame of the world, is ſubject to ſudden changes; there is no mountain, no rock, but the little finger of God can move or pull it down. As <hi>David</hi> ſpake of his metaphoricall mountain, his great outward eſtate. <hi>Lord, thou hadſt made it ſtand ſtrong, yet thou didſt hide away thy face, and I was troubled,</hi> Pſal. 30.6. his mountain began to ſhake, and became a very mole-hill, uſeleſſe to him, when God was diſpleaſed. If the Lord with-draw himſelf from our civill mountains, we are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and if he touch the naturall mountains they are troubled. <hi>Our mountains will skip like Rams; and the little hils like Lambs,</hi> (Pſal. 114.4.) <hi>when he is displeaſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, obſerve, <hi>That the power of God is made viſible to us in the changes which he works in the creature, as well as in the conſtitution of the creature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The power of God made the mountains and created the hils; the ſame power removes mountains, and turns them upſide down. <hi>It argues as great a power to deſtroy the world as to ſettle the world.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſhews what divinity the <hi>Gentiles</hi> might have learned in that great book of the worlds creation (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.) <hi>The invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly ſeen, being understood by the things which are made, even his eternall power and Godhead;</hi> So we may ſay on the other ſide, <hi>The inviſible things of him from the confuſions which are in the world, are clearly ſeen; or,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51057:91"/> they may be underſtood by the things which are removed and changed, in theſe you may read his eternall power and God-head.</hi> When God breaks the laws and courſe of nature, he ſhews his power as well as when he ſetled the laws and courſe of nature. He ſhews his power when he lets the ſea out of it's place to overflow the earth, as well as when he bounded the ſea, that it ſhall not overflow the earth. Some things are with farre leſſe power deſtroied, then made, removed then ſetled, but no power can deſtroy the world, but that which made it, or ſuddenly remove a mountain, but that which ſetled it. The power of God muſt be acknowledged in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering as well as in ordering the naturall courſe or conſtitution of the creature.</p>
                     <p>And if we look to the change of Metaphoricall mountains, it is a truth, an illuſtrious truth, that the Lord diſplaies his mighty power, in removing and over-turning the great eſtates and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments of men or kingdoms. When God removes the mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain of our peace, of our riches, the mountain of outward proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and of civill power, it becomes us to ſay, <hi>He is mighty in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> who doth all theſe things.</p>
                     <p>God hath given us great tokens and teſtimonies of his power in this. How many mountains, great mountains, men who were mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ains, and things which ſtood like mountains in our way, how many (I ſay) of theſe hath the Lord removed? Our eies have ſeen mountains removing, and mighty hils melting: the power of God, and the faith of his people have wrought ſuch miracles in our daies, <hi>He removeth the mountains.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> (Chap. 7.9.) ſpeaks as much of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> under the name of <hi>Ephraim.

There are two ſtates of a man, eaſily diſtinguiſhed, Youth, and old-age, and gray hairs make the moſt viſible diſtinction between theſe two; ſo that to ſay, <hi>Gray hairs are upon him,</hi> is to ſay there is ſuch a change upon his eſtate, as is between a young man and an old man, and yet he knows, he obſerves it not. Of all things a man is moſt apt to take notice of his own naturall gray hairs: and many are ſo troubled at the firſt ſight of them (becauſe they tell us we begin to be old) that they will pick them out; but ſuch
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51057:93"/> is the ſenſleſneſſe of many about the dealings of God with them, that when great changes are upon them, changes like that of youth into old-age, they are not affected with it; providentiall or judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary gray hairs are not often known.</p>
                     <p>Surely many of theſe gray hairs are upon us at this day: it will be ſad if <hi>England</hi> be like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and know it not. It is worſe not to know we have gray hairs, then to have them. The one is but our affliction, the other is our ſinne. Gray hairs are upon us, ſtrangers have devoured our ſtrength; as many oppreſſing mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ains are removed (for which we ought to bleſſe God, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his power) ſo ſome ſupporting mountains have been remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and others ſhake terribly, for which we ought to mourn, and be humbled under the mighty hand of God. If we know not what God hath done, he can quickly doe enough to make himſelf known. <hi>They who will not ſee the hand of God, when it is lifted up</hi> (that they may be humbled) <hi>ſhall ſee it and be aſhamed</hi> (Iſa. 26.11.) if the removing and ſhaking of our mountains doe not awaken us, the overturning of them ſhall; That's the next act of divine power in this noble deſcription.</p>

                     <p>As the ſetling and eſtabliſhment of the creature, is an effect or ſign of his goodneſſe, or as theſe tell us, that God is pleaſed: So when the Lord hurls the creature this way and that way, when he toſſes it up and down, as if he cared not how, this is an argument of his anger; when <hi>Moſes</hi> came down from the Mount, and ſaw what the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had done, how they had made a golden calf and polluted themſelves with idols, ſuch a paſſion of anger came upon him, that he threw the Tables of the Law out of his hand, and brake them. So, when the Lord would ſignifie his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſure, he throws the creature out of his hand, and breaks man againſt man, Nation againſt Nation (as a Potters veſſell) one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another.

It is alſo applied to civill ſhakings and commotions by the troubleſome ſpirits of men (<hi>Prov.</hi> 30.21.) <hi>For three things the earth is diſquieted.</hi> And to unnaturall ſhakings of the earth by the power of God (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.8, &amp;c.) So in the text.</p>
                     <p>Some expound this of a naturall motion. Thoſe men have (ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) a motion and turning in their brains, who tell us that there is a continued motion of the earth, that it turns and never ſtands ſtill; they would ground the motion of the earth upon this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, tranſlating thus, <hi>Which moveth the earth in her place.</hi> But the text tels us, that the earth hath pillars and not wheels. Pillars are made for reſt, not for motion.</p>
                     <p>Further, This text ſpeaks of it, as of an act of Gods anger, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no ordinary act appointed in nature; and the word notes a violent motion, not a naturall. But we need not ſtand to refute this motion. As when ſome denied all motion, a Philoſopher to prove it, roſe up and walked: So when any affirm or give reaſon for this motion, we may ſhew their ſenſes that the earth ſtands.</p>
                     <p>This ſhaking then is extraordinary, the Lord who made the earth firm upon pillars, can make the earth move, as if it went on wheels.</p>
                     <p>This he doth, firſt, by earthquakes, theſe ſhake the earth (as it were) out of her place, and make it tremble. Hiſtories are full, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mens experience can give inſtances of ſuch terrible ſhakings of the earth. This earthquake is not meant here, for there is a reaſon in nature for that. Philoſophers diſpute much about it, and tell us, when there is a ſtrong vapour included or impriſoned in the bowels of the earth, that vapour ſeeking vent maketh a combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there, and ſo the earth ſhakes. This, indeed, ſhews the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power of God, but it is in a naturall way, whereas the text ſeems to imply ſomewhat more, ſomewhat beyond the learning of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and Naturaliſts.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, the text ſaith,
<q>
                           <pb n="184" facs="tcp:51057:95"/>He ſhaketh the earth [out] of her place.</q>

                     <p>Whereas an earthquake ſhakes the earth in her place, and cauſes it to tremble upon the pillars thereof.</p>
                     <p>But did God ever ſhake the earth out of her place? We muſt underſtand the text conditionally. We have not any inſtance that the Lord hath actually done ſo, but this ſuppoſition may be put. The Lord can remove mountains and ſhake the earth, not only in, but out of her place. We finde ſuch conditionall expreſſions often put in Scripture, not as if the things ever had been, or ever ſhould be done, but if the Lord will, he is able to doe them (<hi>Amos</hi> 9.5.) <hi>The Lord God of Hoſts is he that toucheth the land,</hi>

                     <p>The word in the originall ſignifies to ſtand upright, to be erect, becauſe pillars doe ſo. There are two ſorts of pillars, upon which there is a different interpretation of the word.</p>
                     <p>There are, firſt, <hi>Supporting pillars.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Supported pillars.</hi> Or, there are <hi>pillars for ornament;</hi> and <hi>pillars for ſtrength.</hi> We ſet up pillars or pinacles upon the tops of great buildings for ornament, and they are ſupported pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. We may call mountains ſuch pillars: for, as when ſome ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly palace is built, great pillars or pinacles are ſet upon the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and battlements: ſo the Lord having framed the earth, hath ſet up mountains, as great pillars for the adorning of it, <hi>He ſhaketh the earth, and the pillars thereof tremble;</hi> it is true of theſe upper pillars, the mountains they tremble. But I take it rather to be meant of ſupporting pillars, under-pillars, which bear the frame above, and are as the baſes or under-props of the earth (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.) <hi>Who laid the foundation of the earth;</hi> the earth hath a foundation; the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew is, <hi>He hath founded the earth upon her baſis,</hi> alluding to a building. Moſt buildings have their foundations in the earth; but ſome upon it, being raiſed upon pillars. So <hi>Hannah</hi> (1 Sam. 2.8.) in her Song, <hi>The pillars of the earth are the Lords, and he hath ſet the world upon them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What are theſe pillars that the Lord hath ſet the world upon? or where ſhall we finde them?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> ſhews us (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.1, 2.) <hi>The earth is the Lords, and the fulneſſe thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein: for he hath founded it upon the ſeas, and establiſhed it upon the flouds.</hi> It is ſtrange that pillars of liquid water ſhould bear up the maſſie earth; the earth ſeems rather to be the pillar and foundation of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Some interpret <hi>(ſuper)</hi> which ſignifies, <hi>upon,</hi> by <hi>prope</hi> or <hi>juxta neer,</hi> he hath founded it upon the ſeas, that is, He hath found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it by, or neer the ſeas. But take it in the letter, and it is a truth: for the ſea is as much the pillar of the earth, as the earth is the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the ſea; earth and ſea being a globe and round, the ſea is as much under the earth, as the earth is under the ſea. Thus the pillars of the earth are waters, <hi>And the earth is eſtabliſhed upon the flouds.</hi>

                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:51057:96"/>
                     <p>Further, If you would know what theſe pillars are, hear what <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 26.7.) where he aſſures us that God <hi>hangeth the earth upon nothing.</hi> We are not to think that the Lord in framing and building the earth did firſt ſet up pillars, and then ſet the earth upon them, for the earth hangeth as a ball in the midſt of the air, without any pillars under it. Hence <hi>Jobs</hi> Philoſophy teaches us, <hi>That he hangeth the earth upon nothing;</hi> there are no materiall or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pillars to ſuſtain it.</p>
                     <p>What is then the pillar of the earth? What is it that ſupports and bears it up? <hi>The reall pillar of the earth it is the power of God.</hi> But the power of God cannot tremble? How then doth he ſay, <hi>When he ſhaketh the earth, the pillars thereof tremble?</hi>

Is not this an argument of the mighty power of God, that the air which is a body ſo weak, that if you throw a feather up into it, it will not ſtay there, but deſcend, yet the whole maſſe or globe of earth and waters hangs there? God poiſeth it meerly by its own weight: <hi>For he weighed the mountains in ſcales, and the hils in balances,</hi> Iſa. 40.12. He upholds all things by the word of his power, <hi>And hath built this great Caſtle in the air.</hi> Could we enter into the ſecrets of nature, and ſet our faith a work by our ſenſes about theſe things, we ſhould be raiſed above all fear in the greateſt difficulties. If we ſaw but a bullet, or a piece of lead of a pound, yea of a peny weight, lifted up and hang in the air without any thing to ſupport it, we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it a miracle. What thinke you, when all the lead, and iron,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51057:96" rendition="simple:additions"/> and braſſe, and ſtone that is in the world hang in the air without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny viſible ſtay?</p>
                     <p>I finde ſome interpreting this clauſe as the former, in a figurative ſenſe, <hi>He ſhaketh the earth,</hi> that is, States, Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths; <hi>And the pillars thereof tremble;</hi> that is, they who ſeemed to be their ſtrongeſt ſupporters tremble and ſhake. This is a truth, and a profitable one for our meditation. To clear this,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, We finde the earth in Scripture often put for States and Kingdoms (Iſa. 24.20.) <hi>The earth ſhall reel to and fro like a drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and ſhall be removed like a cottage, and the tranſgreſſion thereof ſhall be heavy upon it, and it ſhall fall and not riſe again.</hi> The earth ſhall doe this: what earth? He doth not mean the naturall earth<note place="margin">☜</note> upon which men tread, but the people who tread upon the earth, or that Common-wealth, wherein people are united and governed, theſe ſhall reel to and fro, and be removed like a cottage: As if he had ſaid, you thought your State and Kingdome was ſetled like a ſtrong Caſtle, but I will take it down, as a man takes down a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cottage, raddl'd only with a few ſticks and reeds. Or the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it is, your Common-wealth that hath been founded by the wiſdome of ſo many Law-givers,<note place="margin">Fundavit legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus urbes.</note> and is eſtabliſhed in ſo much riches and power, ſhall be removed as a poor cottage, thorow which every puff of winde findes a paſſage. The ſtrongeſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Bulwarks of the earth, are but as thatcht cottages, when God takes them in hand.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Pillars are as often taken in a politicall ſenſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.3. <hi>The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are diſſolved.</hi> How comes it then to paſſe that they are not utterly deſtroied? It follows, <hi>I bear up the pillars of it;</hi> that is, I maintain Governours and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, ſome in places of power and authority, by whom ſhaking, tottering Kingdoms are upheld. Our experience teaches us this; We live in a Nation, of which we may ſay, <hi>Our earth with the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants thereof are diſſolved,</hi> we are a broken and a ſhattered peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet the Lord bears up our <hi>Pillar, * the Parliament, the politique pillar of our Nation;</hi> we had long ago lain in the duſt, if God had not borne up this pillar. The chief counſels of the adverſary have been to weaken and undermine, to ruine and pull down this pillar. They (like <hi>Samſon</hi>) have taken hold of our two pillars, and bowed themſelves with all their might (<hi>Judg.</hi> 16.28.) but neither have they proved <hi>Samſons,</hi> nor proved us <hi>Philiſtines.</hi>

                     <p>Further, There are <hi>Church-pillars</hi> as well as <hi>State-pillars;</hi> men of eminency in knowledge and learning, in parts and piety; Theſe are pillars of the Church of God. So the Apoſtle cals <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi>

As the Church it ſelf is <hi>the pillar of truth:</hi> ſo ſome particular members are <hi>pillars of truth,</hi> bearing it up, and holding it forth, as pillars doe the Laws or edicts of Princes and Common-wealths.

In great ſhakings of the earth, Common-wealth-pillars tremble, and Church-pillars tremble, yea they would fall, did not the Lord ſuſtain them with his hand.</p>
                     <p>From all, learn the inſtability of the creature. If that which is the baſis or foundation of all outward comforts be ſo eaſily ſhaken and toſt up and down, what are the comforts themſelves? If Kingdoms and Common-wealths totter, who can ſtand faſt? When the Saints feel the world ſhake and tremble under them, their comfort is, <hi>They have received a Kingdom that cannot be ſhaken.</hi> Neither man nor devils have any power to ſhake it, and God will not ſhake it: nay, with reverence we may ſpeak it, the Lord can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhake that Kingdom, for it is his own: he cannot doe any thing to his own wrong or diſhonour. Earth may, but heaven ſhakes not, neither ſhall any of the pillars thereof tremble for ever.</p>

                     <p>The phraſe implies an ordinary, or a common event. But when was there ſuch a thing as this? How rare are ſuch events? I may ask, Did the Lord ever command the Sunne that it ſhould not riſe? Or did ever any day appear, when the Sun did not appear? we may anſwer four or five waies.</p>

                        </note> Some conceive <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks only of what God can doe (as in the former inſtance) not of what he ever did: He never actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gave out his command to the Sunne that it ſhould not riſe, but he hath power to doe it, if he pleaſeth. Many things are ſpoken of the power of God, as preſently done, which onely are things poſſible for him to doe. That's a good interpretation of the place.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We may carry it further, for when he ſaith, <hi>It riſeth not,</hi> we need not take it ſtrictly, as if the Sunne were ſtaid from making day at all; but, it may note any ſtop or ſudden diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sunne.

                        </note> and when the Sunne diſappeareth, or is hidden, it is to us, as if the Sun were not riſen. Thus God hath actually more then once, given out a command to the Sun, not to riſe. <hi>Lavater</hi> (in his comment upon this place) reports, that in the year 1585. <hi>March</hi> 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, ſuch a darkneſſe fell upon the earth, that the fowls went to rooſt at noon, as if it had been Sunne ſetting, and all the common people thought the day of judgement was come. That of the Prophet is true in the <hi>letter,</hi> as well as in the <hi>figure</hi> (Amos 4.13.) <hi>He maketh the morning darkneſſe:</hi> And (Chap. 5.8.) <hi>He turneth the ſhadow of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51057:98"/> death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night.</hi> The holy ſtory records one famous act of God commanding the Sunne to ſtand ſtill (<hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.12.) When <hi>Joſhua</hi> was in purſute of his enemies, he praied that the day might not haſten down: <hi>Sunne, ſtand thou ſtill upon Gibeon, and thou moon in the valley of Ajalon, And the Sunne ſtood ſtill,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſpeaks as if himſelf could command the Sunne, <hi>Sunne, ſtand thou ſtill;</hi> he talks to the Sunne, as to his ſervant, or childe, <hi>ſtand ſtill.</hi> It was indeed at the voice of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> but by the word and power of God, that the Sunne ſtood ſtill. So the Text reſolves, <hi>There was no day like that before it, or after it</hi> (no day ſo long as that) <hi>that the Lord heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the voice of a man.</hi> So then, the Lord hearkned to the voice of a man, and then the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap> hearkened to the voice of a man: Firſt, the Lord hearkned, and then the Sunne hearkned, that is, by a command from God at the requeſt of a man the Sunne ſtood ſtill.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It may be underſtood of ordinary eclipſes, which are diſappearings of the Sunne: and though they come in a courſe of nature, and are by naturall light fore-ſeen many years before they come, yet there is ſomewhat in them, which ſhould fill us with high thoughts of the power of God. And though an eclipſe of the Sun be no miracle, yet God once made, and can again make a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous eclipſe. When Chriſt <hi>the Sun of righteouſnes</hi> was ſhamefully crucified, the Sun in the heavens (as aſhamed to look upon that act (as from man) of prodigious cruelty and injuſtice) hid his face; <hi>and from the ſixth hour</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">Dionyſius Areo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagita.</note> from high-noon) <hi>there was darkneſſe over all the Land unto the ninth hour;</hi> that is, till three in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.45. This eclipſe was miraculous; firſt, becauſe it was the full of the moon. Which (as we receive from <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>) cauſed a great Philoſopher (not knowing what was doing, or who was ſuffering at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) to cry out, <hi>Either the God of nature ſuffers, or the frame of nature diſſolves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe it was univerſall (as ſome affirm) over all the world, or as others (which makes it more ſtrange) that it was only in the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> all the world beſides enjoying the light of the Sunne at that time. Which miracle ſtands oppoſite to that in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which was plagued with darkneſſe, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Goſhen</hi> enjoyed light; whereas then <hi>Judea,</hi> where the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> dwelt, was covered with darkneſſe, the reſt of the world en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying light.</p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:51057:98"/>
                     <p>Fourthly, Some referre this ſpeech of <hi>Jobs</hi> to that particular plague of darkneſſe, for three daies in <hi>Aegypt</hi> (laſt mentioned) which they conceive was then freſh in memory, and ſo <hi>Job</hi> had reference eſpecially unto that, when he ſaith, <hi>He commandeth the Sunne, and it riſeth not.</hi> For though God at that time did not give a command to ſtop the Sunne from riſing upon all parts of the earth, yet he commanded the Sunne not to riſe upon that part; when his own people had light in <hi>Goſhen,</hi> the Lord charged the Sunne not to riſe upon the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> This is a more diſtinct act of the power of God. For, as he ſpeaks, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.7. (to note the accurateneſſe as well as the power of God in his judgements) concerning the rain, <hi>I commanded the clouds</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and I cauſed it to rain upon one City, and cauſed it not to rain upon another City:</hi> So the Lord can cauſe the Sunne, if he pleaſe, to riſe upon one Countrey, and not upon another; upon one Nation, and not upon another; upon one City, and not upon another. Thus we may underſtand it, <hi>He commandeth the Sunne, and it riſeth not</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one people, though it ſhineth upon others, according to the manner of that <hi>Aegyptian</hi> plague.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, We may interpret it of any extraordinary tempeſtuous time, <hi>He commandeth the Sunne, and it riſeth not;</hi> that is, he makes ſuch ſtorms and tempeſts, and cauſeth ſuch vapours and clouds in the air, that the Sunne is mufled up, and is, as if it did not riſe. Such a day (he means it of any troubles and afflictions) we have deſcribed in the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> (Chap. 2.2.) <hi>A day of darkneſſe, and of gloomineſſe, a day of clouds and thick darkneſſe, as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the mountains.</hi> But how is a day of darkneſſe as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſpeech intends thus much, that this darkneſſe ſhall ſpread it ſelf, as ſuddenly as the morning light ſpreads it ſelf upon the mountains, which being higheſt, are bleſt and gilded with the firſt iſſuing raies of the riſing Sunne. God is ſaid to command the Sunne not to riſe, when he vails and masks the face of the Sunne with ſudden clouds, as if there were no Sunne at all but clouds. <hi>Paul</hi> in his voiage to <hi>Rome,</hi> was under ſuch a tempeſt, and the Text ſaith, <hi>That neither Sunne nor ſtarre for many daies appeared</hi> (Act. 27.20.) they were as if the Sunne had not riſen for many daies. Such ſtormy gloomy weather God can make, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 32.7.) <hi>When I ſhall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the ſtars thereof dark, I will cover the Sunne with a cloud;</hi> that is, I will put a black vail or cloak upon the heavens, that the Sunne ſhall not
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51057:99"/> put out any light, when I put them out; when I extinguiſh thee, I will (for a time) extinguiſh the Sunne alſo. The conſtellations of heaven are often expreſſed ſympathizing with the diſpenſations of God on earth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.31. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.29. <hi>He command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or ſpeaketh to the Sun.</hi> Obſerve hence.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The bare word of God is a command.</hi>

                        <hi>He ſpeaks to the Sunne, and it riſeth not.</hi> The Apoſtle uſeth that word about the creation of light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>The Lord who commanded light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, hath ſhined in our hearts:</hi> the Greek is, <hi>The Lord who ſpake light out of darkneſſe,</hi> which we tranſlate, <hi>The Lord who commanded the light out of darkneſſe.</hi> The words of God are Laws, and therefore the <hi>ten Commandments,</hi> that part of the word which carries the name of commands from all the reſt, is yet called, <hi>The ten words of God.</hi> The Greeks call the ten Commandments, the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> or the <hi>ten words;</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words, ſo many commands. The devil ſeems to acknowledge this great power of God (only that he might abuſe it) in Chriſt, that his word was a command, <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God</hi> (Mat. 4.3.) <hi>command that theſe ſtones be made bread:</hi> The Greek is, <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God speak to theſe ſtones that they become bread,</hi> or <hi>speak theſe ſtones into bread:</hi> he would take that as a proof of his Divinity, <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God; doe this;</hi> God can doe this, his Word is a command to all creatures, for whatſoever he impoſeth upon them, they muſt ſubmit to it, therefore doe thou ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſpeak to theſe ſtones, or command theſe ſtones to become bread.</p>
                     <p>It ſhould be matter of comfort to us, while we remember that every word of God is a command upon all creatures, <hi>He hath made a decree which ſhall not paſſe</hi> (Pſal. 148.6.) The Hebrew is only, a word which ſhall not paſſe, his word is a decree, which none ſhall reverſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As from the former clauſe <hi>[He commandeth the Sun]</hi> we learn, that every word of God is a command: ſo from that which followeth <hi>[and it riſeth not.]</hi> We may learn,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That, every creature obeies the command, and ſubmits to the will of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Men often ſpeak, and ſpeak in the higheſt language of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet the thing is not done; but whatſoever the Lord ſpeaks, is done. Every thing hath an ear to hear his voice, who made both voice and ear, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.8. <hi>Fire and hail, ſnow and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51057:99"/> ſtormy winde fulfilling his Word.</hi> Senſleſſe creatures act at Gods command, and goe upon his errand, <hi>They fulfill his Word.</hi> The Lord ſent a meſſage unto <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to aſſure him that his ſickneſſe was at his command, becauſe the Sunne was, (2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.9, 10.) <hi>Shall the ſhadow goe forward ten degrees, or goe backward ten degrees in the diall of Ahaz?</hi> either way (ſaith the Lord) I can doe it; either way, as thou ſhalt ask a ſign, it ſhall be done. And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> anſwered, <hi>It is a light thing for the ſhadow to goe down ten degrees, but let the ſhadow return backward ten degrees.</hi> Yet he knew the Lord did not offer him a light thing in either, when he ſaid, Shall the Sunne goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or backward. The Sunnes going forward was within a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as great a matter as it's going backward; but <hi>Hezekiah</hi> cals it a light matter, in regard of common apprehenſion and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The Sunnes motion is naturally forward, and though it ſhould mend it's pace, many would not much regard it; but all would ſtand and wonder at a retrograde motion, or at the Sun go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backward. Hence <hi>Hezekiah</hi> cals it a light matter for the Sunne to goe forward comparatively to it's going backward. And from either the Lord would teach <hi>Hezekiah</hi> that the creatures will doe what he bids them, even the Sunne will move miraculouſly at his Word. How great a rebuke will it be to man, if he move not at the command of God, and as God commands? Shall the Lord ſay to the Sunne, Riſe not, and it riſeth not; and ſhall he ſay to man, Swear not, and he will ſwear, pray, and he will not pray: ſhall the Lord have better obedience from creatures without life then from man, who hath not only life but reaſon? or from Saints, who have not only reaſon but grace? They who have grace give not ſuch univerſal obedience as things without life: for though there be a part in them active to obey, yet there is a part in them backward to all obedience. Let it ſhame us that there ſhould be any thing in us (who have life, reaſon and grace) reſiſting, or not readily complying with all the commands of God, when the Sunne, which hath not ſo much as life, obeies his voice, <hi>He commandeth the Sun, and it riſeth not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Obſerve from the manner of this ſpeech.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That, The Lord hath a negative voice upon the motion of all creatures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He commandeth the Sunne, and it riſeth not.</hi> It is a royall Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative that the Lord commands the Sunne to riſe, but that the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51057:100"/> Lord hath a power to ſtay the Sun from riſing, lifts up his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the higheſt. In all diſputes about power, his is reſolved to be greateſt, who hath the negative voice, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> checks and ſuperſedeats all others. This is the Prerogative of God; he can ſtay the motion of the Sun, and of man. The Sun dares not do his office to the day, nor the ſtars to the night, if the Lord ſay, No. The Sun is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.5. like a bridegroom comming out of his Chamber, dreſt and prepared, and as a Giant rejoycing to runne his race; but though the Sunne be thus prepared, and dreſt, and ready, yet if the Lord ſend a writ, and a prohibition to the Sunne to keep within his chamber, he cannot come forth, his journey is ſtopt. Thus alſo he ſtops man in his neereſt preparations for any action. <hi>If the Lord will work, who ſhall let it?</hi> Iſa. 43.13. That is, there is no power in heaven or earth which can hinder him. But if the Lord will let, who ſhall work? neither Sunne, nor ſtars, nor men, nor devils can work, if he forbid them. The point is full of comfort. God tels <hi>Abimelech</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Sarah, Abrahams</hi> wife, whom he took into his houſe, <hi>I know that thou didſt it in the integrity of thy heart, but I with held thee, and I ſuffered thee not to touch her</hi> (Gen. 20.6.) And when <hi>Laban</hi> purſued <hi>Jacob</hi> with hard thoughts againſt him, and ſtrong reſolutions to deal harſhly with him; The Lord gave a negative voice, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 31.24.) <hi>Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. Laban</hi> had not the uſe of his own tongue; <hi>He could not speak either good or bad.</hi> Not good or bad! Was there any hurt for <hi>Laban</hi> to ſpeak good to <hi>Jacob?</hi> And the ſtory tels us, that <hi>Laban</hi> ſpake many words, and ſome bad enough to <hi>Jacob,</hi> charging him with a double theft. Firſt, for ſtealing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf away (verſ. 27.) <hi>Wherefore didst thou ſteal away from me?</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for ſtealing his Idols (verſ. 30.) <hi>And now though thou wouldeſt needs be gone, becauſe thou longeſt ſore after thy fathers houſe, yet wherefore haſt thou ſtoln away my gods?</hi> Foul language all, though God charged him not to ſpeak a bad word to <hi>Jacob.</hi> For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer know, We muſt reſtrain that reſtraint to the point of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jacob</hi> back again, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſpeak either good or bad to him,</hi> to ſtop or turn him from his way, thou ſhalt uſe no threatnings to bring him back to thee, no, nor any promiſes or allurements: thou ſhalt make no offers of better entertainment to winne him to thy ſervice, which was the thing he ſo much deſired. <hi>Good and bad</hi> are the two terms of all that can be ſpoken, and where the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams of ſpeaking are forbidden, all ſpeaking to that purpoſe is
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51057:100"/> forbidden. When the ancient people of God <hi>were few in number, yea, very few, and ſtrangers in the land, when they went from one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another, from one Kingdome to another people,</hi> one would thinke, that all the world would have been upon them; but here was their protection, God had a negative voice (Pſal. 105.15.) <hi>He ſuffered no man to doe them wrong.</hi> Many had (as we ſay) an aking tooth at the people of God, their fingers itcht to be dealing with them, and the text ſhews four advantages the world had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: Firſt, They were few. Secondly, Very few. Thirdly, Strangers. Fourthly, Unſetled. What hindered their enemies? It was the Lords <hi>negative voice. He reproved Kings for their ſake, ſaying, Touch not mine anointed, and doe my Prophets no harm.</hi> We ſee an inſtance of this (<hi>Gen.</hi> 35.5.) when <hi>Jacob</hi> and his family <hi>journeyed, the terrour of God was upon the Cities that were round about them, and they did not purſue after the ſonnes of Jacob:</hi> They had a minde to purſue after them, to revenge the ſlaughter of the <hi>Sichemites,</hi> but God ſaid, <hi>Purſue not,</hi> and then they could not purſue, they muſt ſtay at home. And when his people the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſafe in <hi>Canaan,</hi> he encourages them to come up freely to worſhip at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> by this aſſurance, No man ſhall deſire thy Land, when thou ſhalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God, thrice in the year (<hi>Exod.</hi> 24.34.) God can ſtop not only hands from ſpoiling, but hearts from deſiring. Our appetite, whether concupiſcible or iraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, is under his command, as well as our actions. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet aſſerts this by way of queſtion (Lam. 3.37.) <hi>Who is he that ſaith, and it cometh to paſſe, when the Lord commandeth it not?</hi> That is, if the Lord doth not concurre, if the Lord vote againſt the ſaying or command of any man in the world, what he ſaith ſhall never come to paſſe.</p>
                     <p>We ſhould conſider this to help our faith in theſe times. God hath a negative voice upon thoſe counſels and concluſions, which are carried with one conſent of men, <hi>And the wrath of man ſhall either turn to his praiſe, or all that is beyond that,</hi> he will ſtop, <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of wrath</hi> (namely, ſo much as remains over and above what turns to the praiſe of God) <hi>ſhalt thou restrain,</hi> Pſal. 76.6. The ſword is in motion amongſt us, even as the Sunne, and the ſword ſeemeth to have received a charge to paſſe from one end of the Land to the other; yet a counter-command from God will ſtop this ſword from going on. If he ſpeak to the ſword, the ſword ſhall wound no more. We may entreat the ſword to wound no
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51057:101"/> more, as they (<hi>Jer.</hi> 47.6.) cried out, <hi>O thou ſword of the Lord, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put thy ſelf into thy ſcabbard, reſt and be ſtill.</hi> The anſwer was, <hi>How can it be quiet, ſeeing the Lord hath given it a charge againſt Askelon?</hi> &amp;c. Our anſwer might be (changing place) the ſame, How can it be quiet, ſeeing the Lord hath given it a charge againſt <hi>England?</hi> A word from God draws, and a word from God ſheaths the ſword. He that commands the Sunne, and it riſeth not, can command the ſword, and it ſmiteth not, the fire and it burns not, the water and it drowns not, the Lions and they devour not. How happy are they who ſerve the Lord over all!</p>
                     <p>Obſerve fourthly; ſeeing, <hi>He commandeth the Sunne, and it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>That, The daily riſing of the Sunne, is an act of grace and favour to the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Sunne doth not riſe alone of it ſelf, it is the Lord (as we may ſay) that helps it up every morning. Therefore it is ſaid (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45.) <hi>He makes his Sunne to riſe; His Sunne,</hi> mark how Chriſt ſpeaks of the Sunne, as Gods own, that Sunne which he can either cauſe to riſe, or not to riſe, cauſe to riſe upon one people, <hi>and not</hi> upon another, <hi>He makes his Sunne to riſe;</hi> there is an act of common grace in making it to riſe upon any, eſpecially in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it to riſe upon all, upon <hi>the evil, and upon the good,</hi> Mat. 5.41. That God makes the Sunne riſe to give them light, who uſe their eyes onely to rebell againſt the light, how admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is it?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, As to the ſpeciall aim of <hi>Job,</hi> we ſee what a proof we have of the omnipotency of God, <hi>He is great in power, and mighty in ſtrength;</hi> Why, becauſe he can ſtop the Sunne?

But rather,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Sealing is for ſecrecie, or for the hiding of a thing from the ſight of others: So in the ſealing of letters, that they be not ſeen, and of treaſures, that they be not ſtoln or taken away, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.34. <hi>Job</hi> 14.17. Thus the Lord ſeals up the ſtars,<note place="margin">Clauſae viden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, cum non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur.

                        </note> when he clouds or obſcures the ſtars, and will not let them be ſeen. Some make it an alluſion to a book. The heavens are a great volume, wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truths of God are written, his name is there; and the ſtars are as ſo many characters or letters of his Name. He often ſeals up this great volume, and ſo blots theſe letters that no man can read or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The meaning of, <hi>He ſealeth up the ſtars,</hi> may be taken thus, He keeps in, and cloſes up the vertue and influences of the ſtars; he ſtops thoſe treaſures, which uſually come down from the ſtars upon the earth. Naturall Philoſophy teaches us, that all the fatneſſe and fruitfulneſſe of the earth, is convaied from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51057:102"/> Heaven nurſes and ſuckles the earth: and if the Lord pleaſe he can dry up thoſe breſts, ſeal up thoſe influences, ſtop thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret workings which the heavenly bodies have upon the earth. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve hence.</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>As he can ſeal up the ſpirituall treaſures of heaven, that the ſoul ſhall receive no light, comfort or refreſhing from them in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; ſo he ſeals up the naturall influences of the heavens, that the earth and the fruits of it here below ſhall receive no quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, no refreſhing from them. And the earth languiſhes when the Lord ſuſpendeth and ſealeth up the naturall influences of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as the ſoul languiſheth, when the Lord ſtops up the ſpirituall influences of heaven, when he ſeals up that ſtar of <hi>Jacob,</hi> that day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar from on high, Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>What we hear of God in naturall things, ſhould keep us in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall dependance upon him for ſpirituals; he ſeals with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his own Spirit, and he ſeales up all comforts from our ſpirits.</p>

                     <p>But, what are theſe heavens which he ſpreadeth forth?</p>
                     <p>Heaven is ſometimes expreſſed with an addition, <hi>the highest hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the third heavens,</hi> in 2 Cor. 12.12. <hi>The heaven of heavens,</hi> 1 King. 8.27. <hi>Paul</hi> was rapt up to <hi>the third heavens,</hi> that is, in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and revelations he was brought as neer to God himſelf, as a creature poſſibly can. Of this heaven we are to underſtand that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>In the beginning God created the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and the earth, and the earth was without form and void.</hi> He doth not ſay, the heaven which God created at firſt, was without form and void, but the earth was without form and void; for that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was a perfect creature. We read further of the creating of thoſe heavens which we ſee, of the viſible heavens, which are the continent of the Sunne, Moon and Starres. But, <hi>In the beginning God created the heaven;</hi> that heaven which by way of eminency is called, <hi>The habitation of his holineſſe, and of his glory,</hi> Iſa. 63.15. This was created in the beginning, and then, it is conceived the Angels were likewiſe created; but the earth which was then made was an imperfect creature, and all other corporeall creatures with
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51057:103"/> their ſeverall forms and fulneſſe were extracted out of that earth, which was <hi>without form and void.</hi> The very heavens (which we ſee) were made out of that firſt earth, the Sunne, Moon, and the Stars, yea, the very light it ſelf was made out of that earth, that generall heap of matter which the Lord created at firſt, and is ſaid to have been <hi>without form and void.</hi> But the heaven, which we call <hi>the heaven of heavens, the third heaven,</hi> or <hi>the higheſt heaven,</hi> was a perfect creature the firſt day, made without any pre-exiſtent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whatſoever by the power of God. This heaven is the largeſt of all the heavens which God ſpread out.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Take heavens for the viſible heavens. I intend not to ſtay upon philoſophicall conſiderations, only what the Scripture holds forth; we finde heavens put, firſt for the ſtarry heavens or the firmament, where the ſtars have their motion, that's the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven meant (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1.)

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Heaven is taken in Scripture for a nearer heaven, for all that, which is below the Moon, for the air and the clouds. Hence the birds are ſaid to flie in the heavens; and (<hi>Gen.</hi> 8.2.) the rain from heaven was reſtrained, that is, the rain from the clouds, for there is no rain in that heaven above the clouds.</p>

This is a great encouragement to us in great affairs and buſineſſes, in the greateſt ſtraits and difficulties of the times; if men forſake and deſert, the Lord alone can doe all for us; if men have not power to doe what they have will to doe, nor will to doe what they have power; then remember, <hi>He that ſtretcheth out the heavens alone,</hi> can order our works alone, compoſe our differences alone, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer our enemies alone. God alone is infinite, greater, ſtronger, wiſer, then all creatures together.

                     <p>There are other myſticall waves, even waves within us, which will not be trodden upon by any foot, but Gods. There is a ſea of wickedneſſe in every mans heart by nature. Every wicked man is nothing but a ſea, he is a ſea of wickedneſſe. <hi>The wicked</hi> (Iſa. 57.20.) <hi>are like the troubled ſea, when it cannot reſt.</hi> And as the windes blow from all quarters of the heavens, and ſtrive upon the ſeas: So there are divers luſts, which as windes ſtrive upon the face of mans heart, the luſt of pride, the luſt of covetouſnes, the luſts of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, of envy, of malice, theſe enrage and ſwell the waters.

Theſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging waves ſwell too high in his own people; it is the work of his Spirit to tread theſe down; and when the windes of ſeverall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations raiſe thoſe waves, he it is that commands them down. Who amongſt us is there, that one time or other findes not corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption raging, as the high waves of the ſea? How mighty and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull is the Lord in that great work of his effectuall grace, treading upon the waves of this ſea, remaining corruption in his ſervants and children!</p>

Light was created the firſt day (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3.) but the lights were created the fourth day (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.14.) that is, certain veſſels were created to hold the light. And God ſaid, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven; that is, let the light which is now ſcattered thorow all, be gathered in certain receptacles, fit to keep, and yet fitted to tranſmit and diſperſe it into all parts of the world, <hi>Let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light,</hi> verſ. 15.</p>
                     <p>Of theſe lights or ſtars, ſome are called moving, and others fixed. That's the doctrine of Aſtronomers, and it is the doctrine of the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51057:107"/> Scripture. The Apoſtle <hi>Iude</hi> (ver. 13.) calling ſome <hi>wandering ſtars,</hi> ſeems to admit of that diſtinction of the ſtars, into wandering and fixed. The unfixt or wandering ſtars are ſeven, known by their names and motions. Theſe in the Text are none of them; theſe are placed above them.</p>
                     <p>The ſeat of theſe <hi>Aſteriſmes,</hi> is in the eighth ſphear (to take that doctrin for granted, though many diſpute it) or ſtory of the heavens (ſo the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> ſpeaks, Chap. 9.2. <hi>He buildeth his ſtories in the heavens;</hi> we put in the margent, ſphears, <hi>He build<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Some of which fall under ſpeciall obſervation and numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Aſtronomers give us a Catalogue of a thouſand three and twenty ſtars, which they exactly diſtinguiſh; which is the ancient account. And ſince that we have had many more diſcoveries by thoſe noble Navigatours, who have made <hi>thorow-lights to the world,</hi> that the Eaſt might look into the Weſt, and the South into the North: The travell, ſtudy and experiments of theſe Maſters in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation have brought us in an additionall number of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſtars more. And ſo we reckon a thouſand three hundred, and twenty three fixed ſtars known by name; of which theſe in the text are a part.</p>

Hence when the Lord ſhewed <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> how great his ſeed ſhould be, he carries him out, and bids him look toward heaven, and tell the ſtars, if he were able to number them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.5.</p>
                     <p>The ſtars (to come a little nearer the Text) obſerved and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by <hi>Students</hi> in this great volume of the heavens, are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>fourty and one images or repreſentations,</hi> whereof ſome (for learnings ſake) are fancied the images of men and women, others the images of beaſts and fiſhes,<note place="margin">Omnes hae ſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum imagines non tantum or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine &amp; ſitu, verum etiam certis nominibus inter ſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctae ſunt.</note> others the images of things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life.

                     <p>Now, when it is ſaid in the Text, <hi>That God makes Arcturus, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion and Pleiades, and the chambers of the South.</hi> We are not to take them for ſo many diſtinct and particular ſtars, but for conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, or configurations, becauſe they ſtand in ſuch a form or figure:

Mans ſpirit is thus expreſſed, becauſe it lies ſo farre inward (Prov. 24.4.) <hi>By knowledge ſhall the chambers be filled;</hi> that is, the moſt ſecret parts of the ſoul ſhall be filled by knowledge. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.8. <hi>The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of the belly.</hi> Prov. 7.27. <hi>They goe down to the chambers of death;</hi> that is, to the inmoſt and moſt retired waies of death, the grave. Here, <hi>The chambers of the South</hi> are the moſt remote, hidden and ſecret parts of the South. And the reaſon why after he had expreſt the other conſtellations by ſpeciall names, he gives us theſe only in generall <hi>[The chambers of the South]</hi> is, becauſe the ſtars which are under the Southern pole, are hidden from us, and are encloſed &amp; lodged as in a chamber: God locks them up in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and they are ſecrets to this part of the world; the ſouthern Pole being under or below our Horizon. In the artificiall ſphears of heaven we finde few Aſteriſmes or deſcriptions of the ſtarres about thoſe parts; there are many, but we perceive them not. And the vertue and operation of theſe chambered, hidden ſtars, is as ſtrong, as of thoſe, which appear in greateſt luſtre and beauty.</p>
                     <p>Again, When he ſaith, <hi>Which maketh Arcturus</hi> &amp;c. his meaning is, <hi>Which makes them appear,</hi> or do their office. Theſe ſtars were made when the heavens were made, and <hi>Jobs</hi> diſcourſe is not about crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:51057:108"/> but providence. So that to make <hi>Arcturus,</hi> &amp;c. in the ſenſe of this Text, is only this, to order the times of their riſing and ſetting, to diſtinguiſh the ſeaſons of the year, and to produce their ſeverall effects in every ſeaſon, which providentiall acts are here eſpecially aimed at. Thus <hi>he maketh Arcturus</hi> to riſe, about the middle of <hi>September,</hi> which is the time of the <hi>Equinox,</hi> when the civill day and night are even, and ſhare the hours of the naturall day equally between them. Or, as others account, this ſtar riſes about eleven daies before the <hi>Equinox.</hi> So, by <hi>Arcturus</hi> we may underſtand that ſeaſon of the year: <hi>And he maketh Arcturus,</hi> is, he orders and diſpoſeth of the ſeaſon, commonly called <hi>Autumn. Orion</hi> ſhines forth in our <hi>Hemisphear,</hi> about the moneth of <hi>December,</hi> and by that, winter is deſigned. The <hi>Pleiades</hi> begin at the ſpring, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Vergiliae,</hi> becauſe they ariſe <hi>(vere)</hi> in the ſpring, and diſappear or go down toward winter. <hi>The chambers of the South,</hi> are fiery ſtars, which have their chief influence upon us in heat of Summer.</p>
                     <p>And ſo we may put the Text into theſe plain expreſſions, <hi>He maketh Arcturus, Orion and Pleiades, and the chambers of the South.</hi> That is,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He makes and orders <hi>Summer and winter, ſpring and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt,</hi> becauſe theſe ſtars divide the four ſeaſons of the year.</p>
                     <p>Or, ſecondly, thus, <hi>He makes hot and cold, wet and dry, ſtorm and calm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or, thirdly, as theſe fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> conſtellations are aſſigned to the four chief points of heaven. <hi>Arcturus</hi> is known by all, who know any thing in the heavens, to be ſeated about the Northern Pole, whoſe oppoſites are thoſe ſtars in <hi>the chambers of the South. Orion</hi> dwels in the Eaſt, and the <hi>Pleiades</hi> in the Weſt.</p>
                     <p>So the plain Engliſh of the words is this, <hi>That the Lord by his mighty power and wiſdome ordereth and appointeth the motions of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from Eaſt to West, from North to South.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, To clear up the ſenſe of this Text, we muſt underſtand theſe four conſtellations <hi>Synecdochically,</hi> theſe being put for all the reſt; For as God orders theſe, ſo every ſtar in the firmament; the leaſt are under his eie, and at his diſpoſe, as well as the greateſt. But becauſe theſe are the moſt eminent, uſefull and efficacious in their appearances, motions and influences, therefore theſe are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <hi>He maketh Arcturus, Orion and Pleiades, and the chambers of the South.</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, <hi>All the ſtars are placed in the heavens by the ſpeciall deſignment of God for the uſe and good of man.</hi>

                        <hi>Moſes (Deut.</hi> 4.19.) gives a caution to <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the Lord, that they ſhould take heed of imitating the Heathens in their abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and this is one particular, <hi>Leſt thou lift up thine eyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heaven, and when thou ſeeſt the Sunne, and the Moon, and the ſtars, even all the hoſt of heaven, ſhouldeſt be driven to worſhip them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all Nations under the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Obſerve that, <hi>The Lord thy God hath divided them unto all Nations under heaven;</hi> Therefore take heed that thou do not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them. They are the work of God, they are creatures; and worſhip, which is proper to the Creatour, muſt not be given to them. It is a remarkable Text, <hi>Leſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou ſhouldeſt be driven to worſhip them.</hi> How driven? Not by externall force and power, but driven by the ſtrong inclination of thine heart, raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch beautifull objects. The excellency that is in the works of God hath power to draw, yea to drive the heart of man to commit idolatry. <hi>Job</hi> ſhews this, while he acquits himſelf ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly from it (Chap. 31.26, 27.) <hi>If I beheld the Sunne when it ſhined, or the Moon walking in brightneſſe, and my heart hath been ſecretly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, or my mouth had kiſſed my hand; this alſo were an iniquity to be puniſhed by the Iudge,</hi> &amp;c.

Some ſtars are the portion of one people, others of another. As the earth is an inheritance divided among the children of men; ſo alſo are the ſtars and heavens.<note place="margin">Per hanc divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionem intelligit ordinem &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum planetaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, qui in ſuis orbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ita diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntur, ut una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae<expan>

                        </note> We ſeldom conſider what riches we receive from that part of our inheritance; moſt think they live by the earth only; No, ſaith <hi>Moſes, The Lord hath divided the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the Sunne, Moon and Stars, unto all Nations under heaven.</hi> He hath ſetled it, what ſtarre ſuch a Land ſhall have, and in what ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as alſo what proportions of the Sunne and Moon, for light, heat and influence. He hath made them for the children of men. Man is fed and cloathed, warmed and cheriſhed from heaven more then from the earth: and the lot and diviſions which we have of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51057:109"/> the earth, are naturally and uſually good or bad, rich or barren, pleaſant or unpleaſant, healthy or unwholſome, according as the aſpects of the heaven and ſtars, are more or leſſe benigne, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable unto them. <hi>Moſes</hi> (Deut. 29.26.) reproves the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the <hi>Jews</hi> by this argument, <hi>Becauſe they went and ſerved other gods, and worſhipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given to them.</hi> So we tranſlate. But the letter of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew gives it thus; <hi>who had not given to them, or divided among them any portion.</hi> As if <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid, The Lord divided and gave the heavens and the ſtars among you, and theſe baſe dunghill-gods never gave you ſo much as a clod of earth, and will ye depart from <hi>Jehovah</hi> to ſerve them?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve, <hi>God knoweth the number, the names and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all the ſtars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He gives them ſpeciall names. Theſe in the tranſlation are names of mans impoſition. Yet the holy Ghoſt uſes Heatheniſh names in the new Teſtament (<hi>Act.</hi> 28.11.) we read of a Ship, in which <hi>Paul</hi> ſailed to <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe ſign was <hi>Castor and Pollux,</hi> two <hi>Pagan</hi> Sea-gods. It is ſaid, that God brought all the beaſts of the earth to <hi>Adam,</hi> that he ſhould give them names; but he brought not the hoſt of heaven to <hi>Adam,</hi> that he ſhould give them names, he named them himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.4. <hi>He telleth the number of the ſtars, he calleth them all by their names.</hi> Men are not able to tell the number of the ſtars; they tell diſtinctly but to a thouſand three hundered, or a few more, and they are not able to tell all theſe by diſtinct names, but they are conſtrained to reckon them by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations, where a whole family of ſtars are called by one name. The Lord hath made it his ſpeciall priviledge to tell the number of the ſtars, and to call them all by their names. And theſe are named in the Text for all the reſt. Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Some ſtars are more excellent, of greater vertue and name then others; when theſe are named, it is for ſpeciall reaſon. The Lord nameth theſe, as ſtars of more then ordinary dignity. Theſe are in degree next to the Sunne and Moon: when a few are named for many, we uſually name the chiefeſt: as the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Jews are ſet forth by the heads of their Tribes, by the Chiefs; and when a Nation is ſpoken of, it is by thoſe greater names, <hi>the Magistrates and the Miniſters.</hi> Theſe are named, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have moſt to doe, and the greateſt buſineſſe in a Nation. So theſe ſtars are here named, becauſe they are of ſpeciall uſe and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51057:110"/> influence. The Apoſtle gives us this clearly (1 Cor. 15.41.) <hi>There is one glory of the Sunne, another of the Moon, and another glory of the Starres; for one ſtar differeth from another ſtar in glory.</hi> One ſtar hath a more honourable name then another. Some ſtarres God doth not vouchſafe to name particularly to us, when others, which are of greater glory, are. As in a building, ſome parts of it are chief, <hi>The foundation, the top ſtone, the corner ſtone;</hi> the ſtrength and beauty of the whole building are comprehended under theſe. God hath made differences and degrees in all creatures; in the heavenly as well as earthly. The names of moſt ſtars are conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as being of a lower degree. And we finde that whenſoever in Scriptare ſtars are ſpoken of, ſcarce any are named but theſe, and theſe are often named, which implies their ſuperiority and dignity. The Prophet urges this as an argument of humbleſt addreſſes unto, and dependance upon God. (Amos 5.8.) <hi>Seek him that maketh the ſeven ſtars</hi> (that is, <hi>Pleiades) and Orion, and turneth the ſhadow of death into the morning,</hi> &amp;c. He doth not ſay, Seek him that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all the ſtars, the Lord made all. But becauſe he hath given ſo much vertue and excellency to theſe, theſe only are reported as of his making. Here, <hi>Which maketh Arcturus:</hi> (there) <hi>Seek him which maketh the ſeven ſtars;</hi> As if he had ſaid, In thoſe ſtars God hath laid out much of himſelf, and made his power and wiſdome moſt viſible: How much hath God in himſelf, who hath communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ſo much to one ſenſleſſe creature?</p>
                     <p>And though ſtars differ thus one from another, yet they envy not one another. Which leſſons us to be content, though God make our names leſſe named in the world, than the names of many of our brethren; though he truſt more talents to, or put more light into others, than into our ſelves. One ſtar differs from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtar in glory, but no ſtar envies anothers glory.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Job</hi> being about to declare the power and wiſdome of God, gives inſtance (among other things) in this, <hi>He maketh Arcturus, Orion,</hi> &amp;c. Then obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The power and wiſdome of God ſhine eminently in the ſtars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The power and wiſdome of God ſhine in every graſſe that grows out of the ground, yea in every clod of earth much more then in the ſtars of heaven. Much of God is ſeen in thoſe works of God; yea, ſo much, that many have been drawn to make them gods. There is ſo much of God ſeen in the heavens, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Heathens, who had not the true knowledge of God: but his
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51057:110"/> Covenant-people, who knew him, and whom he knew above all the Families of the earth, have been drawn away to worſhip the hoſt of heaven. That place before cited (<hi>Deut.</hi> 4.) hinteth as much, <hi>Take heed, leſt when thou lifteſt up thine eyes to heaven, and ſeeſt the Sunne, and the Moon, and the ſtars, even all the hoſt of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, thou ſhouldeſt be driven to worſhip them and ſerve them.</hi> If thou lift up thine eies to the ſtars, and not higher, even to God who made the ſtars, thou wilt quickly miſtake the ſtars for God, or make the ſtars thy god; the heart of man is mad upon idolatry. Read how often the Jews are taxed with this ſinne, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21.3. and in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.16. and in <hi>Amos</hi> 5.26. which clears this truth, that much of the power and wiſdome of God is ſtamped upon the ſtars; if God did not much appear in the ſtars, ſo many had not taken the ſtars for God, or given them, which is proper and peculiar to God, religious worſhip.</p>
                     <p>There are five or ſix things which ſhew the power of God and his wiſdome in making of the ſtars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The greatneſſe of the Stars;</hi> ſuch vaſt bodies ſhew an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power in their conſtitution. It is incredible to ordinary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (unleſſe men have skill and learning to make it out, and to lay the courſe of nature together) that the ſtars are ſo great. The Sunne is reckoned by Aſtronomers to be one hundred ſixty ſix times bigger than all the earth. The Moon indeed, which is called a great light, is thirty nine times leſſe then the earth, yet that magnitude is farre beyond common apprehenſion. Some other of the planets are almoſt an hundred times bigger then the earth. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the fixed ſtars are diſtinguiſhed into ſix magnitudes, or differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of greatneſſe. Thoſe of the firſt magnitude (which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) are conceived to be one hundred and ſeven times bigger then the whole earth. We look upon a ſtar, as if it were no bigger then the blaze of a Candle, and the Countrey-man wonders if the Moon be bigger then his buſhell, or broader then his Cart-wheel. If the moſt judicious enter the conſideration of theſe things, they may ſoon come to amazement, that ſo many ſtars in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhould be more then an hundred times bigger then all the earth. And if there are ſuch vaſt bodies in heaven, what a vaſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is heaven? That continent muſt needs be exceedingly exceeding vaſt, which contains ſo many exceeding vaſt bodies in it. If we get but a nook or a corner of the earth for our portion, we preſently thinke our ſelves great men: yet what is all the earth to the heavens?
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51057:111"/> And what are the heavens we ſee to that heaven which is unſeen, to which theſe are but a pavement? The heavens which are to us a roof, are but a floor to the higheſt heavens.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond thing which ſhews the mighty power and wiſdome of God in the ſtars, <hi>is the multitude of them,</hi> they are innumerable: Man cannot tell them (only God can) they are like the ſand of the ſea for number. A multitude of little ſands make a huge body; then how great a body doe a multitude of great bodies make?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The ſwiftneſſe of their motion,</hi> that theſe mighty vaſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould be carried about every day, ſo long a journey, and never tire or wear, ſhews infinite power and wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, This is more admirable, the exact order of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That innumerable ſtars ſhould move continually in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and yet not one of them move out of courſe: this regularity of their motion is ſetled by an <hi>ordinance of heaven</hi> (Jer. 31.35.) where the Lord, to aſſure his people that he would be ſteady and ſtedfaſt in the waies of his love to them, and that he would not caſt them off, tels them that he would be as firm to them in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as he is in the ordinances of heaven: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, which giveth the Sunne for a light by day, and the ordinances of the Moon and of the ſtars, for a light by night,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, I have made a ſtatute and a decree which is irrepealable and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable concerning the motion of the ſtars. There is an ordinance of heaven for it: ſo that as the celeſtiall bodies cannot but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the courſe I have aſſigned them for the enlightning of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour parts, while the world laſts: So the Covenant which I have made with you ſhall not fail to give you light. Thus he infers in the next verſe, <hi>If theſe ordinances depart from before me, ſaith the Lord, then ſhall the ſeed of Iſrael alſo ceaſe from being a Nation before me for ever;</hi> but that cannot be, I have eſtabliſhed theſe ſtarres by a firm and perpetuall decree; therefore you are much more eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>And ſuch is the exactneſſe of their order and motion, that the ſtars of heaven are frequently in Scripture called an hoſt or an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: Now an army, as it conſiſts of many perſons (which is one reaſon why the ſtars are called an hoſt) ſo an army rightly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled is caſt into an exact form, and ſo regular for motion, that it is one of the good lieſt ſights in the world. Now the ſtars are the hoſt of heaven, they ſtand (as it were) in battalia, they
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:51057:111"/> 
                        <hi>keep rank and file;</hi> there is not ſo much as one of that great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude out of place; therefore, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.20. where they are ſaid to fight againſt <hi>Siſera,</hi> they are deſcribed fighting in courſes, <hi>The ſtars in their courſes fought againſt Siſera;</hi> as if the ſtars had been drawn up, now one regiment, then another regiment of them, to charge upon <hi>Siſera</hi> and his hoſt: the heavens fought, and the ſtars fought, that is, the Lord by an heavenly power and influence of the ſtars confounded <hi>Siſera,</hi> and all the enemies of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>There is a most efficacious vertue in the stars.</hi> It is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret vertue, and it is a ſtrong irreſiſtable vertue, no power in the creature can ſtop it: Therefore God challenges <hi>Job,</hi> in the 38. of this book of <hi>Job,</hi> v. 31. <hi>Canſt thou binde the ſweet influences of Pleiades, or looſe the bands of Orion?</hi> There are influences in the ſtars, and canſt thou binde them? Is it in the power of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſtop the iſſues and out-flowings of the ſtars? Their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are ſo efficacious, that none can binde them, but he that looſeth them; none can binde them, but the hand and power which made them; there is ſo much efficacy in them, that if God let them go on in their naturall vigour, their effects are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith the Lord, Hoſ. 2.21, 22.) <hi>will hear the heavens, and they ſhall hear the earth, and the earth ſhall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil, and they ſhall hear Jezreel;</hi> As if he had ſaid, The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are next in power to me, they are ſecond to my ſelf in working, <hi>Therefore I will hear the heavens,</hi> the heavens cannot do it, unles I give them a commiſſion, but <hi>I will hear the heavens.</hi> I will leave a power in the heavens, <hi>And the heavens ſhall hear the earth,</hi>

                     <p>The ſtars are the ſervants of God, they receive orders and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from him for all they do. And the reaſon why the Lord did ſo often call his people off from <hi>gazing upon the ſtars,</hi> and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>ſtar-gazers,</hi> was, becauſe they looked no further than the ſtars, they thought the ſtars did all, they did not eie God that made <hi>Arcturus, Orion,</hi> &amp;c. but they only eied <hi>Arcturus,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore he threatens the <hi>ſtar-gazers and monethly prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,</hi> who took upon them to reſolve future events by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of planets, and planetary aſpects; placing an uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able power in the hands of the heavens, and ſtars, whereas I (ſaith the Lord) <hi>make Arcturus:</hi> I made him, and I make him do what I command, not what you fore-tell. Therefore (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.24, 25.) the Prophet ſpeaking of Gods work in making the heavens and the ſtars, preſently adds, how he befools men, that will propheſie from the ſtars, as if they could tell infallibly what ſhall come to paſſe. <hi>I am the Lord that maketh all things, that ſtretcheth forth the heavens alone, that ſpreadeth abroad the earth by my ſelf:</hi> What follows? <hi>That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad.</hi> I ſtretch out the heavens: ſome will needs propheſie out of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, I have ſet the ſtars in the heavens, and they are for ſigns (<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.14.) but I have not ſet them for Prophets: If any preſume to declare or reſolve what ſhall be done, I reſolve to puniſh their preſumption. I take delight to fruſtrate men, who delight in this, and to befool them, who would be thus wiſe. This is my name, <hi>The God that ſtretcheth out the heavens alone, and that maketh divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners mad.</hi> Great diſappointments enrage: and ſome men loſe their reaſon, when they loſe the credit of doing things above rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Becauſe they cannot be as Gods to fore-tell good or evil, they will not be ſo much as men, <hi>He makes the diviners mad.</hi> The Law was peremptory and ſevere againſt them (<hi>Deut.</hi> 18.9.) <hi>There ſhall not be found amongſt you any one that uſeth divination, or is an obſerver of times;</hi> why not an obſerver of times? may we not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve times and ſeaſons? May we not look up to the heavens and conſider their motions? Yes, we may obſerve times holily, but
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:51057:112"/> not ſuperſtitiouſly, as if ſome times were good, others bad, ſome lucky, others unlucky, as if the power of God were ſhut up in, or over-ruled by his own inſtruments and inferiour cauſes, this is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable unto God, and thus the Jews were forbidden to <hi>uſe any divination, or to obſerve times.</hi>

                     <p>The heavens and ſtars are for ſigns, but they are not infallible ſigns. They are ordinary ſigns of the change of weather, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.2, 3. They are ordinary ſigns of the ſeaſons of the year, Spring and Summer, and harveſt and winter; they are ordinary ſigns of a fit time to till and manure the ground, to plow, ſowe and reap. The earth is fitted and prepared for culture by the motion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. The heavens are at once the <hi>Alphabet</hi> of the power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and of our works: we may read there when to do many buſineſſes. <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.22. <hi>While the earth remaineth, ſeed-time and harveſt, and cold and heat, and ſummer and winter, and day and night ſhall not ceaſe.</hi> Thoſe ſeaſons ſhall continually return ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time of the year, meaſured by the Sun, Moon and Stars. Thus, they are ſigns of ordinary events. And God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times puts the ſign of an extraordinary event in them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.29. <hi>Immediately after the tribulation of thoſe daies ſhall the Sunne be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the Moon ſhall not give her light, and the ſtars ſhall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens ſhall be ſhaken;</hi> which, ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand allegorically; others literally of ſtrange apparitions and impreſſions in heaven, either before the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or the day of judgement.

                     <p>But ſhall man from them prognoſticate and fore-tell extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary events? as when there ſhall be famine and peſtilence, war and trouble in Nations? This the Lord abhorreth. The counſels of God about theſe things are written in his own heart; what is man that he ſhould tranſcribe them from the heavens? But if men will ſay, they are written there; God will blot out what they ſay, and prove theirs to be but humane divinations, yea, that they were received from hell, not written in heaven. (Iſa. 47.13.) <hi>I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſigns of them that divine, let now the Aſtrologers, the ſtar-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers, the monethly Prognoſticatours ſtand up and ſave thee from theſe things that ſhall come upon thee: Behold, they ſhall be as ſtubble, they ſhall not be able to deliver themſelves.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51057:113"/> read future events in the book of thoſe creatures. It is our duty to look upon the heavens, as they declare the glory of God; but it is a ſin to look upon the heavens, as if they could declare the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, fates and fortunes of men.

                     <p>Now, that the ſucceſſe of every creature is in God, not in the ſtars, we may ſee; firſt, in the order of the creation; God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the earth, and commanded it to bring forth fruit upon the third day, but the lights in the firmament were made the fourth day: The earth can bring forth without the midwifery or help of the heavens.

The Lord by his Prophet (<hi>Amos</hi> 7.8.) reports ſeverall judgements, from a full execution of which he was taken
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:51057:116"/> off, yet at laſt he reſolves, <hi>I will not paſſe by them any more</hi> (it is the word here) that is, I will not have mercy on them any more, I will not ſpare them any more, the next time I come with my drawn ſword in my hand, I will be ſure to ſmite and wound before I put it up, <hi>I will not paſſe by them any more.</hi> So <hi>[He paſſeth by me]</hi> may note here the ſparing mercy of God. The Lord ſpareth man many times and pardons him, not ſuffering his whole diſpleaſure to ariſe, when man takes no notice, but is inſenſible of it. The word is uſed in this ſenſe (<hi>Prov.</hi> 19.11.) <hi>It is the glory of man to paſſe by an offence;</hi> that is, to ſpare a man that hath offended, not to puniſh him or take revenge: and it is ordinary in our phraſe of ſpeech to ſay, <hi>I will paſſe you by</hi> for this time, that is, I will not take any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere notice, or ſtrict account of what you have done. And we finde in the ſame prophecy of <hi>Amos,</hi> that <hi>to paſſe thorow,</hi> notes judgement and wrath, in the oppoſite ſenſe; In the fifth Chapter, verſ. 17. <hi>In all vineyards ſhall be wailing; Why? For I will paſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row thee,</hi>

When he ſaith, There ſhall be wailing in all vineyards, it implies there ſhould be wailing every where: for if there were joy in any place, it would be in the vineyards; vineyards are places of mirth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing, grapes make the wine, which makes glad the heart of man. Therefore when he threatens, <hi>That in all vineyards there ſhall be wailing;</hi> it is as much as if he had ſaid, There ſhall be ſorrow in thoſe places where uſually the greateſt joy was found, or there ſhall be ſorrow in every place. Joy ſhall diſlodge and give place to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>for, I will paſſe thorow thee ſaith the Lord.</hi> So that as the work of providence in ſparing, and the work of providence in puniſhing, may be underſtood by this word, with a little varying of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.

                     <p>Thirdly, we may take the words, as they are an argument to prove the power and wiſdom of God to be ſuch, as man is no way able to match or to deal withall, which is the ſubject <hi>Job</hi> is upon. He would ſet the Lord infinitely above all that is in the creature, and he doth it there by an argument drawn from his nature. What is
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:51057:116"/> his nature? Why, he is moſt ſimple, he is a ſpirit without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without any compoſition, without any materiality, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, bodily eies cannot behold him, therefore certainly bodies are not able to overcome him. Man being a materiall ſubſtance, is not able to ſee the Lord, then ſurely he is not able to contend with, much leſſe to conquer the Lord; What then doth he med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with him? It was ſaid at the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of this Chapter, <hi>Who ever hardened himſelf againſt him, and hath prospered?</hi> Is fleſh and bloud any match for a ſpirit? If man would ſtrive with God, where ſhould he have him? <hi>He goeth by me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

If a man were to fight with an enemy, whom he could not ſee, and yet his enemy ſaw him; what an advantage had his enemy againſt him? Doth any man harden himſelf againſt God? <hi>He go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by, and we ſee him not;</hi> How then can we deal with him, or ſtand againſt him? Thus (I ſay) it may be an argument to make good that great aſſertion, <hi>That there is no contending with God;</hi> fleſh and bloud are too weak for a ſpirit. It is the argument which the Apoſtle uſes, to ſhew that the devil is too hard for man, <hi>We wreſtle not with fleſh and bloud, but with principalities and powers, with spirituall wickedneſſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. They paſſe by us, and we underſtand it not, they are now here amongſt us, and we take no notice of it: We are no matches for evil ſpirits, much leſſe are we able to match the moſt holy Spirit.<note place="margin">Eſt invicti ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis deſcriptio.</note> 
                        <hi>Spirituall wickedneſſes are ſtrong, but ſpirituall holineſſes are ſtronger.</hi> This third inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation renders the words a deſcription of an invincible enemy.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It may be underſtood in the generall,<note place="margin">Significatur hic ſumma diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia inter Deum &amp; homines: Deus omnia vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det, &amp; rebus omnibus praeſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia &amp; efficaci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> to note the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite diſtance which is between God and man, or the dignity of God above man, The Lord is omnipreſent, he is going by, and he is paſſing on, he is in all places, and he acts his power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom where he pleaſes. Poor man is confined to a place, to a ſpot of earth; when he is <hi>here,</hi> he cannot be <hi>there;</hi> but God is every where: And though God be every where, yet he cannot be ſeen any where, where he is. God ſees all, himſelf being unſeen, and fils all places, his preſence being is unperceived; nothing is hid from him, yet he is hid to every thing, but the faith of his own people. Thus <hi>He goeth, and we ſee him not; he paſſeth on, and we perceive him not.</hi>

                     <p>And ſo the whole is a confirmation and proof of the generall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, that the Lord is infinite in power and wiſdom, and that man is an ignorant narrow-room'd and narrow-hearted weak creature compared unto him. We may form up the Argument thus:

To ſay that a man cannot know when God loveth him, or ſhineth upon him, is to contradict what our Saviour aſſerts, Joh. 14.17. <hi>I will ſend the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him, but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you. Ye know him,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to his people, the Saints ſee God in a ſpirituall ſenſe, or in his workings upon their ſpirits. And though God works much upon our ſpirits, which we know not, yet we have a promiſe of the Spirit, by whom we know God in his workings. Few know when God is nigh, or when he is a farre off, what his goings away mean, or what his commings. But when he cometh to the Saints, they know he commeth; and when he hideth or departeth from them, they know his hidings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partures. Hence their joies and over-flowings of comfort, when he manifeſts his preſence; and hence their bitter complainings and cryings after him, where he ſeems to abſent himſelf and hide his face: yet this Text hath a truth in it, in reference to the inward and ſpirituall, as well as the outward and providentiall dealings of God, that ſometimes, <hi>He goeth by us, and we ſee him not; he paſſeth on alſo, and we perceive him not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence learn; Firſt, That</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God is inviſible in his eſſence, and incomprehenſible in many of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi> Mans eie cannot ſee him: Mans underſtanding cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what he doth.</p>
                     <p>But why ſpeaks <hi>Job</hi> this, as a matter of wonder, if it be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon condition of man-kinde? <hi>Behold, he paſſeth by, and I ſee him not;</hi> who can ſee him? who can perceive or comprehend him? When <hi>Moſes</hi> (Exod. 33.20.) deſired to ſee his face, the Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>No man can ſee my face and live;</hi> God ſpake to <hi>Moſes face to face,</hi> that is, familiarly, as a man ſpeaketh to his friend, yet <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> did not, could not ſee the face of God. No man can ſee God
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:51057:118"/> in his eſſence or nature: A ſight of God would aſtoniſh, yea, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up the creature, <hi>It is death to ſee the living God;</hi> and man muſt die before he can ſee God ſo fully as he may, and know as he is known. But (though the face of God be inviſible) yet his <hi>back-parts</hi> may be ſeen. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith the Lord to <hi>Moſes) there is a place by me, ſtand thou there upon a rock, and thou ſhalt ſee my back-parts;</hi> thou ſhalt ſee much of my glory ſhining forth, as much as thou canſt bear, as much as will ſatisfie thy deſire (were it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times larger then it is) though not ſo much as thou haſt (not knowing what thou askeſt) deſired of me. My Name ſhall be proclaimed, <hi>Gracious and mercifull</hi> &amp;c. the back-parts of God may be ſeen; the inviſible God diſcovereth much of himſelf to man: and ſhews us a ſhadow of that ſubſtance which cannot be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>Some may object that of the Prophet <hi>Iſaias,</hi> crying out, <hi>Woe unto me, for mine eies have ſeen the King, the Lord of hosts,</hi> Chap. 6.5. Seen him? could <hi>Iſaias</hi> ſee him, whom <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> could not? <hi>Iſaias</hi> did not ſee him in his eſſence and nature, but in the manifeſtations and breakings forth of his glory. <hi>His train filled the Temple,</hi> ſaith the Text (<hi>verſ.</hi> 1.) or his skirts. It is an alluſion to great Kings, who when they walk in State, have their trains, or the skirt of their royall robe held up. T'was this train, which <hi>Iſaias</hi> ſaw. He ſaw not God who was preſent, but he ſaw the manifeſt ſigns of his preſence. That ſpeech of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſeemed to ſavour of, and border upon higheſt blaſphemy, and was therefore charged as an article of accuſation againſt him; he was indited of blaſphemy for ſpeaking thoſe words, <hi>I have ſeen the Lord;</hi> his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies taking or wreſting it, as if he had made the Lord corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and viſible with the eie of the body. And it is conceived he was put to death upon that, and one other paſſage in his prophecy, <hi>Cha.</hi> 1.10. calling the Princes of <hi>Judah, Princes of Sodom, and the people thereof, the people of Gomorrah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But though God be thus inviſible in his eſſence, yet there is a way by which the eſſence of God may be ſeen. And of that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> to whom the Lord ſaid, Thou canſt not ſee my face, the Authour to the Hebrews ſaith (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.24.) <hi>That he ſaw him who was invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;</hi> the letter of the text carries a contradiction in the adjunct, it is as much as if one ſhould ſay, <hi>He ſaw that which could not be ſeen.</hi> The meaning is, He ſaw him by the eye of faith, who could not be ſeen by the eye of ſenſe; faith ſees not only the back-parts, but the face of Jehovah: the eſſence of God is as clear to that eye,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:51057:118"/> as any of his attributes, yea his eſſence is as plain to faith, as any of his works are to ſenſe. Thus he is ſeen, <hi>Whom no man hath ſeen nor can ſee</hi> (1 Tim. 6.16.) not the Saints in heaven: they are not able to ſee the Lord in his eſſence, <hi>He paſſeth by them there, and they ſee him not;</hi> in heaven we are promiſed a ſight of him, yet not that fight, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in spirit, for they ſhall ſee God:</hi> and <hi>without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> then holy men ſhall ſee him; the ſtate of the Saints in glory is viſion, as here it is faith (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12.) <hi>We ſhall ſee him face to face, and as he is</hi> (1 Joh. 3.2.) Theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures which ſpeak of the eſtate of the Saints, beholding God in glory, are not to be underſtood, as if the nature and eſſence of God could be ſeen, for no man hath ſeen that, nor ever ſhall; but they are meant of a more full and glorious manifeſtation of God; <hi>We ſhall ſee then face to face;</hi> that is, more plainly, for it is oppoſed <hi>to ſeeing him in a glaſſe;</hi> we ſee him now in a glaſſe, that is, darkly, in ordinances, in duties, in his word, and in his works, but there ſhall be no need of theſe glaſſes in heaven. We ſhall have ſo direct and full manifeſtation of God, that theſe glaſſes which reflect him ſhall be out of uſe. The Saints on earth have ſometimes a ſight of God without a glaſſe, that is, out of all ordinances, promiſes and works either wrought in them or for them. God comes near to their ſpirits, and lifts them above means, and ſhews them his love, and their intereſt in him by an immediate witneſſe of the Spirit, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.8.) For although the water and the bloud (juſtification and ſanctification) never witneſſe without the Spirit; and though the Spirit never witneſſes againſt them, or where they are not; yet the Spirit doth often witneſſe above them, and without them, that is, they not being called forth to give their witneſſe. This is next door to heaven: only, the viſion in heaven will be exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heightned and raiſed, not only above our viſion by ordinances, but above our viſion by immediate revelation or witneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Further conſider, The ſight we have of God is in Chriſt. God is ſeen in every creature (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.) much more in ordinances, but Chriſt is <hi>the expreſſe image of his perſon, and the brightneſſe of his glory, Heb.</hi> 1.3. He is the <hi>medium</hi> by which we ſee God now, and ſome have thought we ſhall ſee him only in Chriſt for ever. But it is out of doubt that in this life God is ſeen only in Chriſt ſavingly. We of our ſelves, are ſo farre off from God, that we cannot ſee him. There muſt be a due diſtance between the organ and the object; we are afarre off from God, untill Chriſt bring us near; we come
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:51057:119"/> to, and ſee the <hi>Father through the Sonne.</hi> And how neer ſoever we are to any object, we cannot ſee it without an eye. We are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blinde, the eyes of our minde muſt be enlightned before we ſee him, Chriſt cleareth our underſtandings, and cures our blindeneſſe, <hi>He is made to us of God wiſdom</hi> (to ſee our need of him to be made) <hi>righteouſneſſe to us, and ſanctification and redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. Again, The <hi>medium</hi> muſt be light; if the eye be clear, yet while the air is dark we cannot ſee. There muſt be an outward light, as well as an inward light to ſee by; that Jeſus Chriſt makes alſo; for <hi>He is the light of the world, as well as the enlightner of every one that commeth into the world.</hi> He ſends the means of knowledge, as well as gives an ability to know. He ſends light to the eyes of our minde, and he is light in the eyes of our minde. What we ought to know comes from him, and how to know as we ought comes from him. Without him, God goeth by us in the Goſpel, and we ſee him not, he may paſſe on for ever, and we never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve, <hi>That as the Lord in his nature cannot be ſeen at all: So (ſuch is the weakneſſe of man, that) we cannot ſee him fully in his word, or works.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How little is it that we ſee, that we know of God in either? What admirable operations are there in the courſe of naturall things, in the Sunne, Moon, and Stars, in the growth of herbs and plants, and in our own bodies, which we ſee not? What admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble adminiſtrations are there in the courſe of civill things? The beginnings, growths and declinings of Common-wealths, the tranſplantations of people from Countrey to Countrey, their oppreſſions by injuſtice, their confuſions by warre, their eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by peace, their conſumptions by plague and famine, their encreaſe by health and abundance are little minded by the moſt of men. How doth God turn Nations up-ſide-down, and hurl King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms together, and we perceive him not. Some take no notice at all of God, as doing ſuch things, none taking ſuch notice as they ought. We obſerve creatures, what this man did, and what the other, ſuch men were malicious and unfaithfull, ſuch were valiant and wiſe, ſuch were ſelf-ſeekers, ſuch ſelf-deniers, ſuch conſtant Patriots, and ſuch were Apoſtates. Thus we ſee men, but we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſee God in the great tranſactions and motions of Kingdoms. And we ſee him leaſt of all in the courſe of ſpirituall things, in his working upon our hearts; God works wonders in us, and we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:51057:119"/> him not! We regard not his commings or goings, his comfortings or with-drawings, when our ſpirits are heated, or when they are cold, when we are ſtrong, or when we are weak: There are continuall varieties and changes in our ſpirits, had we a clearneſſe to make obſervation. The work of God in the heart of a believer moving it, ordering it, preſerving it, comforting it, purging it, is as wonderfull, and more, then any of his works in the whole world.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Note, <hi>Man is not fit to fit as a Judge upon the works and dealings of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Shall we judge God in what he doth, when we cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what he doth? A Judge muſt have the full cognizance of the matter before him, how elſe can he paſſe ſentence about it? Shall man be ſo bold as to get up into the throne, and paſſe ſentence upon what God doth, when he cannot apprehend or take in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of what he doth? <hi>He goeth by thee, and thou ſeeſt him not; he paſſeth on alſo, and thou perceiveſt him not;</hi> And wilt thou cenſure what thou canſt not perceive?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Which is <hi>Jobs</hi> ſcope,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It ſhould be matter of great humiliation to us that we ſee ſo little of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God works round about us and in us, and yet we know little of him. Our blindeneſſe ſhould abaſe us in our own eyes: God is all eye, and all hand, and we ſo blinde that we cannot ſee what his hand doth; It muſt lay man low in his own ſight, to conſider how little he ſees of God.</p>

                        <hi>If he taketh away,</hi> ſuppoſeth he can take away, and he can take all away, and doe us no wrong.

                     </p>
                     <p>He taketh away when creatures take away. It is ſeldom that God dealeth immediately with us in theſe outward providences; he ſends men, ſtirs inſtruments to do what is done. But that which man doth, the Lord doth (Iſa. 42.24.) <hi>Who gave Jacob to the spoilers, and Iſrael to the robbers? Did not I the Lord?</hi> Men ſpoil'd and robbed them, yet it was the Lords act to ſend thoſe ſpoilers, <hi>Did not I the Lord?</hi> As that which man doth in ſpirituals is the Lords act, when man converteth and ſaveth, it is the Lord that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and converteth; when man comforteth and refreſheth by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the promiſes, it is the Lord that comforteth and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; when man gives reſolution in doubts, it is the Lord that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth doubts; mans act is the Lords. So here, when man rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth and ſpoileth us, the act is from the Lord, though the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the act is from the man. The Lord ſuffers men to ſpoil and undoe us, yea the Lord orders them to ſpoil us: it is done not only by his permiſſion, but by his commiſſion; not only with his leave, but by his appointment, <hi>I will ſend him againſt an hypocriticall
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:51057:121"/> Nation, and againſt the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the ſtreets,</hi> Iſa. 10.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve thirdly, <hi>What the Lord will doe, either by himſelf or by inſtruments, no man can ſtop or prevent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If he taketh away, who ſhall hinder him?</hi> The Lord hath abſolute power, if he will overthrow men, or families, or whole Kingdoms, none can ſtay him. There have been four great Monarchies in the world, and the Lord comming in judgement againſt them, hath taken all away. The united ſtrength of all creatures cannot ſtand before him, when he is angry and reſolved. The <hi>Babylonian</hi> could not ſay and perform it, I will keep my throne: The <hi>Perſian</hi> could not ſay and do it, I will keep my State: The <hi>Grecian</hi> could not ſay and maintain it, I will keep my glory: The <hi>Roman</hi> could not ſay and make it good, I will keep my empire. When the Lord had a minde to it, he came and fetch away the power and glory, the crown and dignity of thoſe Monarchs, he threw down their thrones, brake their ſtates, darkned their glory, diſſipated their empires, no man could hinder him. <hi>How are ye fallen from heaven O Lucifers, ſons of the morning, how are ye cut down to the ground, which did weaken the Nations? Though ye ſaid in your hearts, We will aſcend into heaven, we will exalt our thrones above the ſtars of God: We will aſcend above the heights of the clouds, we will be like the moſt high; yet how are ye brought down to hell, to the ſides of the pit? All that look upon you ſay, Are theſe the men that made the earth to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that did ſhake Kingdoms?</hi> Thus the Lord hath taken away the <hi>thrones of Princes,</hi> and none could hinder; he hath alſo removed the <hi>Candleſticks of Churches,</hi> and none could hinder. Chriſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> that he would come and take away their Candleſticks: which of theſe hindered him? Both Crowns and Candleſticks muſt down, if he ſpeak the word. It is ſaid, when <hi>David</hi> kept his fathers Sheep, there came a Lion and a Bear, and took a Lamb and a Sheep out of the flock, but he aroſe and went out after them, and reſcued both Lamb and Sheep, taking the prey out of their teeth: When the Lord Chriſt, the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> will come, and tear and take away, no <hi>David</hi> can reſcue out of his hand. The five Kings that came againſt <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> took away <hi>Lot, Abraham</hi> went with his army and made them reſtore, made them bring back again; it is ordinary with man, when one hath robbed another, for a ſtronger to make
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:51057:121"/> him reſtore and vomit up the ſweet morſels, which he hath ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. It is not thus with God.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Power cannot doe it: though the inſtruments which he uſeth to take away from us be weak, yet the ſtrong ſhall not be able to make the weak reſtore. A weak Nation may deſtroy a ſtrong Nation, and the ſtronger ſhall not be able to make the weaker reſtore, if the Lord ſend them. When the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> encamped about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he warns them by his Prophet, doe not thinke you ſhall deliver your ſelves by your great ſtrength, I have ſent them to take your City and your State, <hi>And though they were all wounded me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, yet they ſhall riſe up and take your City</hi> (Iſa. 43.13.) <hi>I will work</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and who ſhall let it?</hi> Who ſhall let it? Why, they might ſay, We will have ſome that ſhall let it: No (ſaith the Lord) none ſhall let it; <hi>Behold, I have ſent to Babylon, and deſtroyed all their Princes,</hi> thoſe that fought to hinder me in my work by their power and counſell, are broken, though they ſeemed as ſtrong as iron bars (ſo the word is,) Theſe bars of iron cannot keep me from entring, I will break all oppoſition raiſed againſt my work.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As power cannot hinder him, ſo policy cannot; no counſell ſhall ſtop him: They (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.6.) took counſell and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſtrongly, <hi>We will go up againſt Judah, and destroy it, and ſet a King in the middeſt of it, even the ſonne of Tabeal;</hi> The Lord anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the next words, <hi>It ſhall not ſtand, neither ſhall it come to paſſe:</hi> You reſolve to doe it, you make it out in your counſels, how to hinder mine, but it ſhall not be, it ſhall not come to paſſe. As no counſell againſt us ſhall ſtand, if the Lord be with us (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.10.) So no counſell for us ſhall ſtand, if the Lord be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, When the Lord is reſolved to take away the peace and glory of a Nation, or of a Church, he will doe it, and no ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all means ſhall hinder him, praier it ſelf ſhall not hinder him. If any thing in the world can move the Lord to reſtore, when he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the peace of a people, it is praier and the cry of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Praier hath often met the Lord, as <hi>Abigail</hi> did <hi>David</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.) and prevailed with him to put up his ſword, which was ready to deſtroy. At the voice of praier the Lord hath reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that which he took away, and hath ſtaied from doing that which he ſeemed fully reſolved to doe, Pſal. 106.23. <hi>The Lord would have deſtroyed them, had not Moſes his choſen ſtood before him
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:51057:122"/> in the breach.</hi> Did <hi>Moſes</hi> out-power the Lord? did he out-wit, or out-policy the Lord? No, but <hi>Moſes</hi> praied, and praied ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Lord was hindered, that is, he, as if he had been hindered, did not effect the thing, he reſtored their comforts again, when he had areſted but ſome of them, and ſeemed to come armed with reſolution to take all away. Yet ſometimes we finde the Lord will come and take away, and praier it ſelf, praier and faſting, cries and tears ſhall not hinder, God will trample upon all theſe. <hi>God was reſolved to take away the glory of Iſrael;</hi> and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them that he would, he takes away that wherein their chief aſſurance lay, that he would not (Jer. 15.1.) <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Though Moſes and Samuel ſtood before me, yet my minde could not be toward this people,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, Ye think to hinder me now, ye will ſtop me, ye will ſend out praier, your old friend, which hath helped you heretofore at many a dead lift. And if you cannot pray enough your ſelves, you will procure praiers, and pray in the aid of praier from all the favourites that I have in the world, ye will get <hi>Moſeſes</hi> and <hi>Samuels,</hi> ſuch as they, to pray for you; ye may doe ſo, if ye will, but it ſhall not profit you, they and ye ſhall loſe your labour, even theſe labours will not quit coſt or be worth the while, to the end ye aim at, for, <hi>Though Moſes and Samuel ſtood before me, and intreated for this people, yet my minde could not be toward them: caſt them out of my ſight, and let them goe forth, ſuch as are for the ſword, to the ſword, and ſuch as are for death, to death, and ſuch as are for captivity, to captivity.</hi> Thus, I ſay, ſometimes the Lord is ſo reſolved to take away life, riches, glory, peace, the all both of perſons and Nations, that nothing ſhall help us, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, no, not the praiers and cries, not the ſupplications and tears of his own people, which are the ſtrongeſt ſtops of all in the way of provoked juſtice. If praier cannot ſtay deſtruction, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a reprieve from death, if the praiers of a <hi>Moſes</hi> and a <hi>Samuel</hi> cannot, nothing can; it is, as if God had ſaid, The beſt means ſhall fail you, therefore all means ſhall fail you: if when praier cannot hinder God, we reſort to other meanes, it is as if we ſhould thinke to faſten an Anchor with a twined threed, which hath broken a cable; or to conquer an enemy with a pot-gun and a bull-ruſh, whom we could not with ſword and Cannon, And as God will not ſometimes be entreated, ſo he ought not at any time time to be queſtioned; which is the next point.</p>

                        <hi>Why doe ye ſit ſtill</hi> (ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.14.) <hi>Aſſemble your ſelves, and let us enter into the defenced Cities, and let us be ſilent there, for the Lord hath put us to ſilence, and given us waters of gall to drinke, becauſe we have ſinned againſt him. The Lord hath put us to ſilence;</hi> that is, the Lord hath done theſe things, and we are not to queſtion him about them, or to ask him what he hath done, or why he hath done thus? Therefore let us be ſilent, ſay they. Let us not murmure at, and complain over our own ſufferings, much leſſe tax and charge God for his doings. It becomes us to obey Gods ſuſpenſion; to be ſilent, when he puts us to ſilence. The Lord never ſilences any (unleſſe in wrath to thoſe who would not hear) from ſpeaking in his name, and publiſhing his vvord. But he hath ſilenced all from ſpeaking againſt his works; and it will be ill with us, if our paſſions (how much ſoever God ſeems to act againſt us) ſhall take off this ſuſpenſion. The Lord is uncontrollable in all his works. When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> (Dan. 4.35.) came to himſelf, and began to think and ſpeak like a man, after he had been among the beaſts: ſee what an humble acknowledgement he makes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God: <hi>All the inhabitants of the earth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:51057:123"/> as nothing, and he doth according to his will in the army of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and among the inhabitants of the earth, and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, What doeſt thou?</hi> Here, we have both parts of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpeech; none can ſtay his hand, which is the former; and none can ſay unto him, <hi>What doest thou?</hi> which is the later. That great Monarch acknowledged he had no power to queſtion God, though he at that time had power to queſtion all the men upon the earth. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſpeaks like <hi>Job.</hi> A wicked man may make a true report of God. Many ſpeak right of the Lord, whoſe hearts are not right with him. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was converted from beaſtlineſſe, but I finde not that he was converted to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. He came home to his own Court, but I ſee no proof that he came home to the Church of God; yet, ſee how divinely he ſpeaks, and how humbly he walks, not ſo much as offering to ask God (who had chang'd him from a Commander of men to a companion of beaſts) <hi>What doeſt thou?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may ask the Lord (in one ſenſe) <hi>what he doth?</hi> Yea, the Lord doth nothing in the world, but his Saints and ſervants are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of him about it. He invites them to petition for what they would have, <hi>Ask of me things to come concerning my ſons, and concerning the work of my hands command ye me,</hi> (Iſa. 45.11.) Though man cannot order or enjoyn the leaſt thing upon God, yet at the entreaty of his people, he is as ready to doe, as if he were at their command. And as we are thus envited to ask things to come, ſo we are not totally denied to ask about things already done. We may ask him in an humble way for information, not in a bold way of contradiction. We may in zeal to his glory, not in diſcontent with our own condition, expoſtulate with him about what he hath done. So <hi>Joſhua</hi> (Chap. 7.7, 8.) <hi>Alas O Lord God, wherefore haſt thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to deſtroy us? Would to God we had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and dwelt on the other ſide Jordan,</hi> &amp;c. but how durſt <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſpeak thus? What if God vvould deſtroy them, vvas it not his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to bear it, and let God alone? Yes doubtleſſe, and ſuch I doubt not vvas the frame of <hi>Joſhuas</hi> ſpirit. If <hi>Iſrael</hi> only had been to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, <hi>Joſhua</hi> had held his peace, at leaſt from ſuch language; but he ſaw a further matter in it; the glory of God vvas like to ſuffer in their ſufferings: the cloſe of his praier betraies this holy diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his heart, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>And what wilt thou doe unto thy great name?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Lord, the matter were not much, though the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:51057:123"/> name of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were blotted out from under heaven, ſo thy Name were written in fairer characters. But I fear a blow to <hi>Iſrael</hi> will be a blot to thy name, and therefore I have taken upon me to pray this praier unto thee, and I have praied rather for thee, than to thee. All praiers are made to God, and yet ſome are made for him. Not that he hath any want, or is in any the remoteſt poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of any danger, but only for the promoting of his glory, and that the world may not have occaſion of a diſhonourable thought of him, whoſe honour never abates in it ſelf, or in the eyes of his own people. Thus we may ask him what he hath done, and why he hath brought ſuch deſolations upon his people. But we may not ask him what he hath done, either to queſtion his right to doe it, or to queſtion his righteouſneſſe in doing of it. No creature may put the queſtion upon either of theſe terms, <hi>What haſt thou done?</hi> much leſſe conclude, Thou haſt done that which thou haſt no right to do, or, thou haſt been unrighteous in doing it. Either of theſe is higheſt blaſphemy: for, whatſoever the Lord doth, he hath right to doe, and whatſoever the Lord doth, he is righteous in doing it.</p>
                     <p>Hence it followeth by way of corollary, That</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lord is of abſolute power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is the <hi>Soveraign Lord, Lord over all;</hi> there is no appeal from him, no queſtioning of him. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh of the power of a King, in this language (Eccleſ. 8.4.) <hi>Where the word of a King is, there is power, and who may ſay unto him, What doest thou?</hi> But is there nothing which a King doth, about which it may be ſaid unto him, What doſt thou? And what is this word of a King? The word of a King, is the Law of his Kingdom: all that a King doth or ſpeaks beſides the Law, he ſpeaks as a man, not as a King; and that's the meaning of <hi>Solomons</hi> text; vvhich Court-flatterers have corrupted with their unſound gloſſes, as if every word of a King were of abſolute power, and muſt have peremptory obedience. A King is for his Kingdom; and while he commands according to the rules and laws of his Kingdom, no Subject may queſtion him, or ſay unto him, What doeſt thou? There is no power above his power, as he is armed with the power of his Laws. And becauſe whereſoever the Word of God is, there is his Law, therefore whereſoever the Word of God is, there is power, and no man may ſay unto him, What doeſt thou? Every vvord of direction, ſpoken by God is a Law, becauſe his vvill is the Law of all things
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:51057:124"/> and perſons. As the will of man by nature is not ſubject (by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying) to the righteous Law of God, neither indeed can be; ſo the will of God by nature is the ſubject, containing all righteous Laws, neither indeed can it not be: for though God be voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with higheſt freeneſſe righteous, yet he is righteous ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, and with greateſt undeclinableneſſe; As he is freely what he is, ſo it is impoſſible for him, not to be what he is. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man ought to ſay to God, What doeſt thou? ſeeing God can doe nothing, but what he ought. In vain then is God either attempted by power, or ſollicited by praier againſt his own minde; For,</p>

The word is uſed to the ſame ſenſe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.23.) where the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth his people, <hi>That Kings ſhall be their nurſing Fathers, and Queens their nurſing Mothers, they ſhall bow downe to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick the duſt of thy feet.</hi> The Church ſhall have the honour to be honoured by the Kings and Princes of the world, they being converted ſhall bow downe ſo low to the Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter

                     <p>The meaning of all is plainly this, <hi>That except the Lord himſelf ſuspend his own act, and restrain his anger, no power in heaven or earth, how strong, how proud, how confident of ſucceſſe ſoever, is able to force him, or to alter him. Helpers ſhall not help themſelves, much leſſe thoſe to whoſe help they come, againſt the minde and purpoſe of God.</hi> Obſerve here, firſt,</p>

                     <p>The paſſion of anger is aſcribed to God, yet the anger which we ſay is in God, hath no power over God: Mans anger uſually <hi>masters</hi> him; but God is alwaies <hi>master of his anger;</hi> that is, he can turn and with-draw his anger when he pleaſeth. There is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation in God; when he is offended, he is not moved; his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are all without upon the creatures, he hath none in his own boſom. The paſſions of the Lord are his moſt ſerious counſels &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations; and we therefore ſay, he is angry, becauſe thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of his acted, look like the effects of anger. Secondly, obſerve,</p>
                     <p>That, <hi>It is not in the power of man to turn away the anger of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He doth not ſay, except men by praier or other means ſtop the anger of God, but, <hi>Except the Lord with-draw his anger all help is vain.</hi> Praier is ſaid to appeaſe the wrath of God, and to ſtay his anger; <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood in the gap, and <hi>Aaron</hi> came out with incenſe to turn away his wrath, yet it is an act of Gods will, which turns away his anger, not the force of our praier; praier therefore prevails with God, becauſe he hath ſaid, it ſhall. He is infinitely free when himſelf acknowledges that we laythe powerfulleſt reſtraint upon him: when the Lord is turned by praier, it is his will to be turned; it was his counſell, and is his command that praier ſhould be made as a means to turn him; and it is his promiſe, that he will turn to us when we pray. Then it appears to us that the Lord hath decreed to do a thing, when he ſtirs up the hearts of his people to pray for the doing of it, and that he is purpoſed to with-draw his anger, when he draws out their hearts ſtrongly to entreat his favour.

What if the people of a provoking Nation aſſociate themſelves together, or aſſociate themſelves with other Nations, or call in help and aid from all that are round about them, ſhall they therefore eſcape in their wickedneſſe? they ſhall not eſcape. Unleſſe God help our helpers, they are helpleſſe to us. When many companies, and great Commanders repaired to <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Ziklag, David</hi> went out to meet them (<hi>Chron.</hi> 12.17.) <hi>and ſaid, If ye be come peaceably to help me, mine heart ſhall be knit to you, but if ye be come to betray me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Amaſai</hi> who was chief of the Captains, anſwers (<hi>v.</hi> 18.) <hi>Thine are we, David, and on thy ſide, thou ſon of Jeſſe: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy helpers, for thy God helpeth thee!</hi> Our helpers cannot give us peace, unleſſe God give them peace; our helpers muſt be helped by God, before they can give us help. The anger of God breaks all the ſtaves we lean on, and makes them as reeds, which wound rather then ſupport; till God is quiet all is unquiet, and when he is unpacified, men ſhall be unpacified, or their peace ſhall be to our loſſe. As if he with-draw his anger, enemies ſhall oppoſe in vain: ſo except he with-draw his anger, friends ſhall help in vain.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>They who ſtrive to deliver thoſe whom God will deſtroy, ſhall fall themſelves before God.</hi>

                     <p>If God be reſolved upon the thing, not only they that are help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the helpers alſo ſhall ſtoop under him: helpers cannot help themſelves when he is angry; they ſhall be like Idols, which have eyes and ſee not, hands and cannot act, either to ſave themſelves, or thoſe that truſt upon them. The greateſt ſtrength in the world without God, it is no better then an Idol, which is nothing in the world. Strength cannot be ſtrong for it ſelf, and help cannot help it ſelf. Our help ſtands in the Name of the Lord, which made heaven and earth, and not in the name of any creature under any part of heaven, or upon the face of the whole earth.</p>

                     <q>How much leſſe ſhall I anſwer?</q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Shall I anſwer]</hi> There is a two-fold anſwering, both appliable to this Text.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, There is an anſwering by way of fact, a reall anſwer, or anſwering to a condition. Thus one man anſwers another that is of equall power and ſtrength, of the ſame meaſure in abilities and gifts with him. Thus alſo, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks (<hi>Prov.</hi> 27.19.) <hi>Face anſwers face in the water,</hi> that is, the face ſeen in the water is of the ſame feature and complexion, with that which looks upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thus bodies and buildings anſwer one another, when they carry the ſame dimenſions: and thus money anſwers all things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it bears value with every thing.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is anſwering by word, which is two-fold: Firſt, Contradictory. Secondly, Satisfactory. The former is, that which the Apoſtle forbids ſervants to uſe (Tit. 2.9.). <hi>Exhort ſervants to be obedient unto their own maſters, and to pleaſe them well
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:51057:128"/> in all things, not anſwering again.</hi> Servants cannot plaaſe their maſters, unleſſe they anſwer to what they are demanded, and they cannot pleaſe their maſters, if they oppoſe what is duly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, this anſwering again is unſeemly in ſervants.</p>
                     <p>The later kinde of anſwering, is that which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> charges upon all Chriſtians (1 Epiſt. 3.15.) <hi>Be alwaies ready to give an anſwer to every man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you, with meekneſſe and fear.</hi> To anſwer thus is every mans duty, both to God and man. To anſwer by contradicting the command of God, is rebellion. To anſwer by ſatisfying the demands of God, is a duty. To anſwer by a proportion to the power or wiſdom of God, is infinitely beyond mans ability; <hi>Job</hi> abhor'd the firſt, he was ready (as well as he could) to perform the ſecond; and therefore <hi>Job</hi> is chiefly to be underſtood of the third, <hi>How much leſſe ſhall I anſwer him?</hi> That is, I doe not look upon my ſelf as a match for God, as if I had ſtrength proportionable to his ſtrength, or wiſdome ſutable to his, as if I could thunder like him. I do not thinke that I am able to anſwer his reaſon by my reaſon, no, I am ſo farre from an ability to anſwer him with reaſon, that I know not how to chuſe out words to reaſon with him, <hi>How much leſſe ſhall anſwer him</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>From the whole obſerve before I come to particulars,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A godly mans t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> had gone thorow the ſeverall ſeries of the creatures; and finding them unable to contend with God, concludes himſelf more unable then they. Doubtleſſe he might have anſwered God as well as any. If any are able to contend with God, godly men are, they have the greateſt ſtrength. Such of them eſpecially as <hi>Job,</hi> a man of that height and elevation of ſpirit in holineſſe, of whom God had given his word, That there was none like him in the earth. What creature (except an Angel) came ſo nigh the Creatour as <hi>Job?</hi> and yet when he had looked over them all, he ſaith, <hi>How much leſſe ſhall I?</hi> He thought any one might enter the liſts, and contend with the Lord better then he. Man (having reaſon) is more able then all the irrationall creatures, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, godly men, and among godly men, they who reach the higheſt degrees of godlineſſe, are moſt able, and yet <hi>Job</hi> a man ſet upon the top and pinacle of all perfection attainable in this life, ſaith, <hi>How much leſſe ſhall I?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They of whom God hath the higheſt thoughts, have the meaneſt
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:51057:129"/> thoughts of, and put the loweſt rates upon themſelves.</hi> No man ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a fairer or more valuable certificate from God then <hi>Job</hi> did, and yet no man could ſpeak more undervaluingly of himſelf then <hi>Job</hi> did.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve, <hi>The more we know God, the more humble we are before him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> having much knowledge of God, quickly found out his own utter inſufficiency to deal with God; <hi>How much leſſe ſhall I anſwer him?</hi> Not, that he had leſſe ability to anſwer God then others, but being more acquainted with God, and living nearer God then others, he ſaw his own inſufficiency more then others. The more communion we have with God, the more knowledge we have of God, the leſſe and the lower we are in our own eyes. The reaſon why men are ſo full of pride, is, becauſe they are ſtrangers from God, they know nothing of him as they ought. And proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, as any one is further diſtant from, or more ignorant of God, the more doth pride prevail upon him, even as humility grows more humble in proportion to his nearer approaches. When <hi>Job</hi> was yet brought nearer to God, he was more humbled, <hi>Ch.</hi> 42.5, 6. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eie ſeeth thee;</hi> that is, I have a clearer and more glorious manifeſtation of thee to my ſoul then ever, I now perceive thy power, thy holineſſe, thy wiſdom, thy faithfulneſſe, thy goodneſſe, as if they were corporeall objects, as if I ſaw them with mine eye, <hi>Wherefore I abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes;</hi> he could not goe lower in his thoughts of himſelf, then this expreſſion laid him. Abhorrence is a perturbation of the minde, ariſing from vehement diſlike, or extreameſt diſ-eſteem. Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſtrictly taken, is hatred wound up to the height. As exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the higheſt act of joy, and delighting the higheſt act of love, ſo abhorring is the deepeſt act of hatred, and to <hi>abhorre, repenting in duſt and aſhes,</hi> is the deepeſt act of abhorrence: Thus low <hi>Job</hi> goes, not only to a diſlike, but to the furtheſt degree of it, abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of himſelf, when he ſaw the Lord. So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of his Prophecy) when God came neer him, and he ſaw ſo much of God, cries out, <hi>I am undone, for I am a man of polluted lips;</hi> but did not <hi>Iſaiah</hi> know he was a ſinfull man, a man of polluted lips till then? Yes, but he was never ſo ſenſible of it, as then. He ſaw his own pollution more then ever by the light of the glory of God that ſhone round about him. He never ſaw himſelf ſo clearly, as when the majeſty of God dazel'd his eyes. When the Sun ſhines
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:51057:129"/> bright into a room, we may ſee the leaſt mote in the air; ſo when the glory of God irradiates the ſoul, we ſee all the motes and atoms of ſinne, the leaſt ſpot and unevenneſſe of our hearts or lives; this brings the ſoul low, and will keep it ſo. <hi>The more we know of God, the more we honour him, and our ſelves the leſſe.</hi> Theſe two are eminent effects of knowing God. As God riſes in our thoughts, ſo we fall. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had been wrapt up into the third heavens, and had a multitude of divine revelations, cals himſelf, <hi>The leaſt of the Apoſtles</hi> (1 Cor. 15.9.) and <hi>leſſe then the leaſt of all Saints</hi> (Epheſ. 3.8.) not that any thing can be leſſe then the leaſt.

                     </p>
                     <p>The Queſtion imports an inability in him for reſolution. He thought himſelf ſo much leſſe able to anſwer then they, that he could not tell how much leſſe.

As it is among perſons and things, ſo among words, there are choice words: ſome are but rubbiſh, refuſe words; others are precious, wiſe, ſutable words: <hi>How ſhould I chooſe out my words to reaſon with him?</hi> Shall I think by ſetting words in a curious frame to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with God? or ſhall I by ſpeaking rhetorically and elegantly overcome him? There is much power in oratory, in choice of words, and therefore the holy Ghoſt forbids the Miniſters of the Goſpel to ſpeak with choice words, in that ſenſe, namely, with
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:51057:130"/> rhetoricall and artificiall ſtrained eloquence, which naturally plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ear, and takes the heart: which kinde of ſpeech, is called, <hi>wiſdome of words</hi> (1 Cor. 2.17.) <hi>and the enticing words of mans wiſdome</hi> (Chap. 2.4.) They, having an aptneſſe in them to entice or perſwade, are called enticing or perſwaſive words. And becauſe he would have little or nothing of the creature ſeen in winning ſouls, therefore the Apoſtle profeſſes he uſed not ſuch eloquence of words. Great Oratours have carried whole Aſſemblies by the ears. And leſt it ſhould be thought that the Miniſters of the Goſpel convert men with oratory, therefore they muſt not uſe ſuch <hi>choice words.</hi> It becomes them not, like Rhetoricians and Orators, to poliſh their ſtile with an affected curioſity, and exactneſſe of language. But as affected language is ſinfull, ſo neglect or rudeneſſe of ſpeech is not without blame. We ſhould labour to ſpeak properly and weightily: ſo it becomes us to chooſe our words, and not to ſpeak till we have heard what our ſelves would ſay. And thus <hi>Job</hi> knew he ought to chuſe his words, when he ſpake to God, but he knew alſo he could not make any ſuch choice, either of rhetoricall and perſwaſive words, or of logicall and argumentative words, as might fit him to anſwer God, or reaſon with him.

                     <p>M. <hi>Broughton</hi> refers the word <hi>[chooſing]</hi> to <hi>Job,</hi> and not to words, thus, <hi>Shall I chooſe to word it with God?</hi> to plead and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the buſineſſe with God?

                     <p>But here a doubt may ariſe from a paſſage (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.3.) where <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I deſire to reaſon with God;</hi> how then doth he here ſay, <hi>Shall I chooſe out words to reaſon with God?</hi> As if he had ſaid, by no means, I will not doe this thing; and yet there he ſeems very ambitious of the attempt, and confident of the ſucceſſe, <hi>I deſire to reaſon with God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, there is a two-fold reaſoning with God. There is a reaſoning of declaration, and a reaſoning of conteſtation. When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I deſire to reaſon with God,</hi> his meaning is only this, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to declare and ſet forth my caſe and condition before him.

                        </gap>r, <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks in that 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter comparatively, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much he had rather declare his caſe to God, then to his friends: God was a better friend to unboſome himſelf to, then any of, or all his three friends; for he ſaith of them in the very next words, <hi>Ye are forgers of lies, ye are all phyſicians of no value;</hi> to what purpoſe would it be for me longer to make known my caſe, and ſhew my grief to you? I had rather reaſon with God then man. But as for that other reaſoning, by way of conteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and quarrelling with the providence or works of God, <hi>Job</hi> profeſſeth in this place, he had no minde to it: he would never chooſe that task, or ſet himſelf to chooſe out words for that end, it was too high for him. He ſaw it was neither wiſdome nor duty to deal with and undertake God, either with an open, or a cloſed hand, either with logicall ſubtilties, or rhetoricall flouriſhes.</p>
                     <p>Again, Whereas <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, he would not reaſon with God; it will be queried, May we not reaſon with God at all? The Lord himſelf ſaith (Iſa. 1.18.) <hi>Come, let us reaſon together.</hi> If the Lord calleth us to reaſon with him, may we not then reaſon with him? Is it not ſinfull modeſty to refuſe what God offers? To clear that,</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, There are two waies wherein we may not reaſon with God.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. We muſt not reaſon with him in our own ſtrength.</item>
                        <item>2. We muſt not reaſon with him upon our own worth.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>And that is the full meaning of <hi>Job, I would not chooſe to reaſon with God,</hi> that is, to reaſon with God in my own ſtrength, as if I
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:51057:131"/> had power to deal with him. Or ſecondly, I would not reaſon with God upon my own worth, as if there were any thing in me upon which I were able to make it out that God ought not to deal thus with me; and that's clear by the words which follow, <hi>Though I were righteous, yet would I not anſwer;</hi> that is, I would not at all ſpeak with God ſtanding upon this bottome, or under the title of my own worthineſſe. In either of theſe waies it is ſinfull to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with God. But we may reaſon with God in the way of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before ſpoken of.</p>
                     <p>In praier there is a reaſoning with God; and the reaſonings and pleadings that are in praier, are the life and ſtrength of praier. Praier is not only a bare manifeſtation of our minde to God, by ſuch a ſute or petition; but in praier there is, or ought to be a holy arguing with God about the matter which we declare, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ch is a bringing out and urging of reaſons and motives, whereby the Lord may be moved to grant what we pray for. The praiers of the Saints recorded in Scripture are full of arguments.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall ſhew it in one example, as a taſte for the reſt; <hi>Iacob</hi> in his diſtreſſe at the approach of his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> flees to God in praier (<hi>Gen.</hi> 32.) and he doth more then ſpeak in praier, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, yea, he wreſtles with God in praier. The ſumme of it is ſet down (<hi>verſ.</hi> 11.) <hi>Deliver me, I pray thee;</hi> to the undertaking of this deliverance he urgeth the Lord by no fewer then ſeven argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Firſt, From Gods Covenant with his Anceſtours, <hi>O God of my father Abraham</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, Remember thoſe names with whom thou madeſt ſolemn Covenants of protection both to them and their poſterity. The ſecond is from Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular command for this journey, Thou ſaideſt unto me, Return, I departed not on my own head, but by thy direction; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou canſt not for thy honour, but free me from danger, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at thy word I am fallen into it. Thou, O Lord, art even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to give me defence, while I yeeld thee obedience. Thirdly, He puts him in minde of his promiſes, thou ſaidſt, <hi>I will deal well with thee,</hi> and that includes all other promiſes made unto him, theſe he makes as a Bulwark to defend him, or as his anchor in the ſtorm. This anchor muſt fail, and this bulwark be broken down before the danger comes to me. If thy promiſe ſtand, I cannot fall. The fourth is the confeſſion of his own unworthineſſe. Faith is alwaies humble, and while we are moſt confident in Gods word, we are moſt diſtruſtfull of our own deſert, <hi>I am not worthy of the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:51057:131"/> leaſt of thy mercies.</hi> Though I am thus bold to urge thy Covenant, yet I am as ready to acknowledge my own undeſert: Thou art a debter by the promiſe thou haſt made to me, not by any perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of mine to thee. Fifthly, He ſeeks to continue the current of Gods favour, by ſhewing how plentifully it had already ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him; which he doth by way of Antitheſis, ſetting his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer poverty in oppoſition to his preſent riches, <hi>With my ſtaff I paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this Jordan, and now I am become two bands;</hi> That is, thou haſt bleſſed me abundantly, and ſhall my brothers malice blaſt all? am I encreaſed only to make him abound? The ſixth argument is, the greatneſſe and eminence of his peril, verſ. 11. <hi>I fear lest he will come and ſlay the mother upon the children;</hi> a proverbiall ſpeech in the holy language, like that of cutting off branch and root in one day, both denoting totall exciſion, or an utter overthrow. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly, He ſhuts up, by re-enforcing the mention of the promiſe, which he urgeth more ſtrongly then before; there it was only, <hi>Thou ſaidst, I will deal well with thee;</hi> but here it is, <hi>Thou ſaidest, in doing good, I will doe thee good,</hi> that is, as it is rendred in our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>I will ſurely doe thee good,</hi> and therefore let not my brother doe me evil. We ſee <hi>Jacobs</hi> praying was a reaſoning with God, and himſelf in the iſſue got not onely a new bleſſing, but a <hi>new name, Iſrael, a Prince with God, a prevailer both with God and men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus we may reaſon with God in the ſtrength, and for the ſake of Chriſt in all our praiers. For as when God cals for our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, he uſually adds perſwaſion to his precept, and reaſons with us, as well as directs us; His commands are not alwaies bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authoritative, and the reſolves of his prerogative: So, when we call upon God for audience, we ſhould adde perſwaſions to our petitions, and reaſon with him, as well as entreat him. Only we ſhould be carefull to reaſon from right Topicks, and heads of argument, ſuch as theſe,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, From the freeneſſe of the grace of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, From the firmneſſe of his promiſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, From the greatneſſe of our need, or of the Churches miſery.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, From all the concernments of his own glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus we may reaſon with God for the doing of any thing we ask accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will; and in theſe reaſonings, the ſpirit, life and ſtrength of praier conſiſts.</p>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:51057:132"/>
                     <p>So then, the only thing which <hi>Job</hi> declineth, as ſinfull and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becomming, is, to reaſon with God as a contender, he might hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly reaſon with him as a Petitioner, or as a remembrancer, <hi>Put me in remembrance</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.26.) <hi>Let us plead toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: declare thou that thou maiest be justified.</hi> We may declare our cauſe, and we need not fear to declare our ſinnes, that God may juſtifie us; but we muſt not preſume to declare our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that we may juſtifie our ſelves: this <hi>Job</hi> diſclaims.</p>
                     <q>How much leſſe ſhall I anſwer him, and chooſe out words to reaſon with him?</q>
                     <p>Towards the further clearing of theſe words, we may take notice that <hi>Job</hi> puts himſelf under a double relation. In the former part of the verſe he puts himſelf in the Reſpondents place, <hi>How much leſſe ſhall I anſwer him?</hi> And in the later part of the verſe he puts himſelf in the Opponents place, <hi>and chuſe out words to reaſon with him.</hi> His meaning is, If the Lord will object againſt me, I am not the man who dares, or is able to anſwer him. And if I ſhould take upon me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt the Lord, the Lord may, and can eaſily anſwer me. From which notion of the words, two points may be obſerved.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>No man can anſwer what God hath to object against him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lord hath a thouſand arguments which we are not able to give him ſatisfaction in (as was touched in the beginning of this Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.) <hi>We cannot anſwer him one of a thouſand.</hi> If God ſhould caſt a man to hell, what hath he to ſay for himſelf, as from himſelf, when God objects, <hi>Thou haſt ſinned.</hi> If God afflict a man and lay him low, giving him this argument for what he doth, <hi>I am thy Creatour; I formed and made thee; if I break thee to peeces,</hi> what canſt thou ſay againſt me? If the Lord ſhould ſay, <hi>I am thy Soveraign,</hi> I have ſupreme power over thee, may I not doe with thee what I will? What hath man to anſwer? Man muſt be ſilent, and lay his hand upon his mouth: he hath not a word of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or holineſſe to reaſon againſt God in any of his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Let man (on the other ſide) gather as many arguments as he can to object againſt God, he is able to wipe them all off preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to blow them away with a breath. All the ſhifts and apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, the excuſes and arguings which any make for their ſinnes, or which they make for themſelves againſt the juſtice and wiſdome of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:51057:132"/> God, are anſwered with a word. So that, put man in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, or in the reſpondents place, he can make no worke of it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve from this phraſe, <hi>Shall I chooſe out words to reaſon with him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God is not taken with words.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fine phraſes and eloquent ſpeeches will not carry it with him, <hi>If we would prevail with God, we muſt speak our hearts to him, rather then our words;</hi> yet we ought to chuſe out words (as was touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before) when we ſpeak to God. As we muſt take heed how we hear, while he ſpeaks; ſo we have need to take heed what we ſpeak in his hearing. That's <hi>Solomons</hi> advice, Eccleſ. 5.2. <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be haſty to utter any thing before God.</hi> That is, ſpeak not vainly and unadviſedly, thy tongue running before thy wit. Let wiſdome guide thy tongue, and let thy heart ſhew thee wiſdome; <hi>Let not thy heart be haſty to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> when it's office is to conceive, not to utter. But how can the heart be haſty to utter? Utterance is the buſineſſe of the tongue. The heart is then haſty to utter, when it ſuffers the tongue to utter what it ſelf hath not thorowly conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by meditation, and made it's own. As in the body, ſo in the minde, the third concoction is that which nouriſhes and aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. So then, <hi>Solomons</hi> meaning is; Let not raw, unboiled, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted thoughts, paſſe out into diſcourſes, or be ſtampt into words before the Lord. As there is a ſinne of curioſity, ſo there may be a ſinne of neglect. <hi>Extreams are equally dangerous.</hi> The diſtance that is between God and us, proclaims this duty of our moſt reverent addreſſes to him. <hi>He is in heaven, and thou upon earth, therefore let thy words be few;</hi> and yet the fewneſſe of words pleaſes God no more then the multitude of them doth. We ſay, <hi>In many words, there can hardly be a ſcarcity of errours;</hi> and in a few words there may be not a few errours, poſſibly more errours then words. <hi>Fewneſſe,</hi> ſimply taken, is not the grace of words. But becauſe they who ſpeak but little, doe uſually thinke the more, and ſo their words are ſteept long in their hearts, therefore few words are uſually <hi>choice words.</hi> It is ſinne, if we are well conceited of our words. And it is ſinne, if our words be not our beſt conceptions. <hi>How ſhall I chooſe out words to reaſon with him?</hi>

                        </note>This brings the matter to the height; Who? I reaſon and plead with God? I anſwer him? No, <hi>Though I were righteous, yet would I not anſwer him.</hi> The ſtrength of the argument lies thus, as if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, <hi>I am ſo farre from entring a conteſt with God, that I profeſſe I would not doe it, though I had the greateſt advantage and fitneſſe to doe it of any man in the world: though I were righteous I would not do it. I doe not ſay, that the reaſon why I would not plead with God, is becauſe I am wicked, ſinfull and abominable, more guilty and unright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous then my neighbours, or then you, my friends, but how righteous ſoever I were, I would not do it. Job</hi> ſpeaks as a man who would ſhew how much he dreads the power and ſtrength of another; <hi>What? I fight with ſuch a man? I contend with ſuch a man? No, I profeſſe I would not fight with him, though I were as well weapon'd, arm'd and prepared, as any man in the world, I would not come near him.</hi> If there be any armour or weapon, any furniture or preparations which may enable man to contend with God, it is the <hi>armour of righteouſneſſe,</hi> and the furnitures of grace. Now, ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> though I had that armour, <hi>Though I were righteous I would not contend with him.</hi> The Apoſtle argues much after this rate (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.) about that great point of Goſpel-charity, where he telleth us, that all things are as nothing without charity: and he inſtanceth in thoſe things which ſtand higheſt in the thoughts of man, to commend him to the acceptation both of God and man, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>Though I have the gift of prophecy, and underſtand all myſteries and all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and though I have all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains; and though I ſhould give my body to be burned, and have not love; what would it advantage me? Though I ſhould give all my goods to the poor, and have not love,</hi> &amp;c. It is poſſible for a man to give away abundance to the poor, and yet have a dearth of love both to them and to God in his heart: all the love that moveth him may be love to himſelf; therefore (ſaith he) <hi>Though I give my goods to the poor, it profits me nothing;</hi> he puts all theſe ſuppoſitions, which are the greateſt advantages for heaven (except Chriſt) imaginable, and yet concludes all, but as ſounding braſſe, or a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>inkling Cymbal, nothing but noiſe without charity. So here, to ſhew how impoſſible a thing it is for creatures in their own ſtrength to contend with God, he puts a ſuppoſition upon that
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:51057:133"/> which is moſt probable to carry us thorow it, <hi>Righteouſneſſe, Though I were righteous, I were not able to anſwer him,</hi> no not I.</p>
                     <q>Though I were righteous.</q>
                     <p>It is, as if <hi>Job</hi> had further expreſt himſelf to this ſenſe, <hi>I am ſo farre from justifying my ſelf in all my complainings</hi> (which was the thing his friends taxed him with) <hi>as if God could finde nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe in what I have spoken, that I freely confeſſe there is not the moſt conſiderate, righteous or holy action that ever I did in my life, which I durſt bring to the touchſtone, to the balance, to juſtifie my ſelf before God by, no, but in ſtead of that I would fall down and abaſe my ſelf, as knowing I am before him, whoſe eyes (being ten thouſand times brighter then the Sunne) are able to ſee unrighteouſneſſe, where I ſee nothing but righteouſneſſe: Doe not thinke I am juſtifying my ſelf as a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man in what I have ſpoken or done, for though I were righteous, yet I would not (upon that ground) goe about to plead my cauſe or ſtand it out with God.</hi> Or thus, <hi>I know I am unrighteous and unclean, but if I were righteous, I would not anſwer him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here a Queſtion or two muſt be reſolved: As,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Was not</hi> Job <hi>righteous?</hi> He puts the Queſtion, <hi>Whom, though I were righteous;</hi> was <hi>Job</hi> an unrighteous man? Doth not he himſelf ſay (Chap. 29.14.) <hi>I put on righteouſneſſe, and it cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me?</hi> Why then doth he here only make a ſuppoſition of it, <hi>Whom, though I were righteous,</hi> when as there he makes it a poſition, that he was cloathed with righteouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer (to clear this Scripture) Man is righteous in a double oppoſition. Righteous; firſt, in oppoſition to the wicked: and theſe may be taken in three ranks, either, Firſt, the abominable and profane: Or, ſecondly, hypocrites and unſincere: Or third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, oppreſſours, and ſuch as are unjuſt in their dealings toward men. As righteous is oppoſed to wicked in theſe three, <hi>profane, hypocrites,</hi> or <hi>oppreſſours,</hi> ſo <hi>Job</hi> was a righteous man. <hi>Job</hi> was not profane, he feared God: <hi>Iob</hi> was not an hypocrite, he was perfect and upright: <hi>Iob</hi> was not an oppreſſour, the loins of the poor bleſſed him. And that's the peculiar ſenſe of the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, I <hi>put on righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is, righteouſneſſe in all my dealings with men.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Righteous is oppoſed to imperfect, or that which hath any failing or want in it. And in this ſenſe <hi>Iob</hi> was not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous; and that's his meaning here, <hi>Though I were righteous;</hi> that is, though I had the uttermoſt perfe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But there is a righteouſneſſe in which we may anſwer God; <hi>Jobs</hi> ſuppoſition excludes not that; namely, the righteouſneſſe of faith which we have by Chriſt.

Chriſt hath not compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our creditour, for our debts, but paid them to the utmoſt farthing. A believer is able to anſwer God, and doth anſwer him every day: when he asks the pardon of ſinne, he offers the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt. And that which he offereth by faith, he will ſtand to and plead with God upon; God hath what he can

                     <p>Hence obſerve, Firſt, <hi>Job</hi> having ſhewed the weakneſſe and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the creature in his former diſcourſe, here you ſee whither it tended, namely, to prove man to be ſinfull and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. This teaches us,</p>

                     <p>Man is an unrighteous creature, therefore a weak creature. <hi>Job</hi> argues from the effect to the cauſe, from the fruit to the root:<note place="margin">Ex effectis cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam declarat, unde enim tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta in mentibus hominum caligo &amp; inſcitia, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de tanta infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitas corporum &amp; animorum, niſi ex peccato? <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thirdly, Obſerve the vaſt difference that is between the ſpirit and temper of a godly man, and of a wicked man. O the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Jobs</hi> ſpirit! <hi>Job</hi> vvill not juſtifie his own righteouſneſſe, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie himſelf in his righteouſneſſe. A vvicked man vvill juſtifie his ſinne, or juſtifie himſelf in his ſinne. A <hi>Saul</hi> vvill juſtifie his diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but a <hi>Job</hi> vvill not juſtifie his obedience. <hi>Job</hi> vvill not take upon him to be a righteous man; though God had told him he vvas perfect and upright. A vvicked man vvill take upon him to be righteous, though God tell him to his face a thouſand times, that he is vile and filthy. How doe vvicked men ſeek for pleas and covers to make themſelves appear righteous! How doe they gild the baſe metall of their hearts, and paint over thoſe rotten poſts to make them appear beautifull! Chriſt tels the Phariſees that they vvere like filthy ſepulchres, full of dead mens bones, yet they vvould be painted over vvith the notion of a righteous gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. <hi>Job</hi> vvho had much righteouſneſſe and faithfulneſſe in him, vvould not own them, and modeſtly bluſhes at the praiſe of God, <hi>Though I were righteous, yet I would not anſwer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Obſerve, <hi>The righteouſneſſe of man is not pleadable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the righteous God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Though I were righteous, yet I would not anſwer him.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.) gives a parallel teſtimony, <hi>Though I know nothing by my ſelf, yet am I not hereby juſtified. Paul</hi> knew nothing by himſelf, that is, he had not any guilt upon him that he knew of; he did not allow himſelf in any ſinne, but kept his conſcience void of offence, both toward God and toward man; yet (though it vvas thus vvith him) he diſclaims all opinion of himſelf, I <hi>am not hereby juſtified,</hi> this is not the plea I have to make before God; he is able to finde out failings vvhere I finde none, he knows better then I, vvhat I am.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Obſerve, <hi>A godly man looks upon his own righteouſneſſe, as no righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Whom, though I were righteous, I would not anſwer.</hi> His ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition hath a negation in it, I <hi>am not righteous. Job</hi> did not deny the vvork of the Spirit, or the grace of God in him; but he vvould not own them in his pleadings vvith God. He could ſtand upon his terms vvith men, and let them knovv vvho he vvas, and vvhat he had done (and it vvas reaſon he ſhould) but before God he had nothing to mention but Chriſt: In reference to the higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, of grace for ſanctification vve muſt <hi>forget all that is behinde,</hi>
                        <pb n="265" facs="tcp:51057:135"/> and preſſe <hi>on to that which is before:</hi> And in reference to the whole grace of juſtification, we muſt forget all our ſanctification. The leſſe we remember our own righteouſneſſe, the more righteous we are in Chriſt. As vve abate in our ſelves, vve encreaſe in him. Chriſt draws the picture of an hypocrite to the life (<hi>Luk.</hi> 18.) in that parable of a <hi>Phariſee and a Publican,</hi> going up to the Temple to pray; and the deſign of Chriſt in that Parable, is held forth at the ninth verſe, to be the conviction of ſuch <hi>as truſted in themſelves that they were righteous, and despiſed others.</hi> Now vvhat did this Phariſee? <hi>He thanks God he was not as other men, extortioners, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, adulterers, or as that Publican, and then he mindes God that he gave tithes, and kept faſts twice a week,</hi> and ſo makes a goodly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of himſelf, both in the negative and in the affirmative, vvhat he vvas, and vvhat he vvas not. Never did any good man tell God ſuch a ſtory of his own life, as this Phariſee told. The Saints love to do well, more then to hear vvell from others, much more, then to hear well from themſelves; they love to do good, more then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive good, much more, then to ſpeak good of themſelves. When Chriſt is repreſented ſitting in judgement (<hi>Mat.</hi> 25.35.) he tels the faithfull of all their good deeds, or acts of charity, <hi>I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye cloathed me.</hi> &amp;c. Hear how the Saints anſwer, as if they had done no ſuch thing; <hi>when was this Lord? when ſaw we thee hungry and fed thee?</hi> &amp;c. We have forgot the time. They did ſo little minde the good they had done, that they remembred not they ever did it. The Lord keeps a faithfull record of vvhat his people doe, but themſelves doe not. It is our duty to remember to doe good, but let God alone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the good we have done. <hi>The Lord is not unrighteous to forget our labour of love</hi> (Heb. 6.10.) but we loſe our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, unleſſe vve forget it. If we much remember what we doe, God will remember it but little: The ſervants of God know well enough when they doe good (to do good ignorantly, is a degree of doing evil) They know vvhen they doe good, and they know vvhat good they doe; but vvhen 'tis done, 'tis to them as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (Iſa. 38.3.) put God in minde of his good deeds, <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>remember how I walked before thee with an upright heart</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> deſired the Lord to remember his <hi>uprightnes.</hi> So <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in divers paſſages of that book (<hi>Chap.</hi> 13.14.22.29.31.)
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:51057:136"/> puts the Lord in remembrance of his righteouſneſſe. But it is one thing to put the Lord in remembrance of vvhat vve have done <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorically;</hi> and another thing to plead vvhat vve have done <hi>legally.</hi> Its one thing to ſhew to the Lord the vvork of his own grace in us; and another thing minde the Lord of our vvorks to obtain his grace. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> vvould have God to take notice of vvhat he vvas to pity him in his ſickneſſe, Lord, I am thus, remember the work of thy hands, as I am thy creature; remember the vvork of thy Spirit, as I am a new creature, as I am thy ſervant. And <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> puts all upon the ſcore of mercy: He did not ſay, Lord, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me for vvhat I have done, anſwer me according to vvhat I have done, but, <hi>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and ſpare me according to the greatneſſe of thy mercy</hi> (Chap. 13.22.) If Saints at any time remember God of their works, it is not to ground an argument of merit upon their vvorks, but to ſhew God the vvork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his grace and ſpirit.</p>

                     </p>

                     <p>As praier prevails, ſo no plea in praier can prevail, unleſſe vve plead <hi>pity, pity, mercy, mercy;</hi> a ſuppliant looks for all good at the hand of free grace. We at any time have ſinne enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us evil (Jer. 4.18.) <hi>Thy ſinnes have procured theſe things unto thee:</hi> But we never have goodneſſe enough to procure us any mercy. Mercy comes for mercies ſake.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In that he ſaith, <hi>I would make ſupplication to my Judge.</hi> Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God is the Judge of all our actions and intentions.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> was in a great conteſt with men, but (ſaith he) men are not my Judges, God is my Judge, <hi>It is a comfort to the Saints to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that God is their Judge. Job</hi> vvas not afraid of God in that relation; no, it was a rich conſolation to think that God vvas his Judge. He is a righteous Judge, a mercifull Judge, a pitifull Judge; we need not be afraid to ſpeak to him under that notion. <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith not, I vvill make ſupplications to my father (vvhich is a ſweet relation) but (vvhich is moſt dreadfull to vvicked men) he conſiders God as a Judge: The Saints are enabled by faith to look upon God as a Judge, vvith aſſurances of mercy.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Obſerve, <hi>The whole world ſtands guilty before God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(Rom. 3.19.) <hi>Every mouth muſt be ſtopped: Iob</hi> vvill only make ſupplication, he had nothing elſe to doe or ſay, <hi>We doe not preſent our ſupplications unto thee for our righteouſneſſe, but for thy great mercy</hi> (Dan. 9.8.) We can get nothing from God by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our mouths in any other ſtile, or upon any other title then this, of an humble acknowledgement of our unworthineſſe: the lower we goe in our own thoughts, the higher we are in the thoughts of God; and we finde the more acceptance with him, by how much the leſſe acceptance vve think vve deſerve. <hi>Nothing is gained from God, either by disputing or by boaſting. All our victory is humility.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, That, he ſpeaks exceeding humbly and ſubmiſſively of himſelf, <hi>my voice;</hi> what am I, a poor creature, that I ſhould think I had carried the matter with God?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That, he ſpeaks very wiſely and underſtandingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature and efficacy of praier, and the means procuring anſwers of praier. When man praies, God anſwers; but he doth not anſwer, becauſe man praies.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That, he ſpeaks very highly and gloriouſly of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, though providence act darkly towards man. We pray, God anſwers, and doth us good, yet things may goe quite contrary in appearance, <hi>If I had called, and he had anſwered me, yet would I not believe that he had hearkned unto my
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:51057:139"/> voice;</hi> why? <hi>He breaketh me with a tempeſt. God was breaking him, and hearing him at the ſame time.</hi> God may be doing us good, when the ſigns he gives ſpeak evil, he hears and anſwers us praying to him, when we think we hear him thundering terribly againſt us.</p>
                     <p>Hence, Firſt, We learn, That</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Praier is calling upon God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then, the heart ſhould be very attentive upon God in praier. How can we expect God ſhould hear us, when we doe not hear our ſelves! In praier we call upon God, therefore we ſhould call upon our ſelves to conſider how and what we pray.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Note, <hi>Praier granted is praier anſwered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If I had called, and he had anſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>red me.</hi> The Lord from heaven ſpeaks to us in every act of his providence; his ſpeaking to us, is in doing for us. The works of God are anſwers to man. God doth not anſwer audibly or ſenſibly; there is a voice in his diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. As men (<hi>Prov.</hi> 6.13.) So the Lord ſpeaks to us with his feet, and anſwers our praiers with his fingers, that is, his works and waies are demonſtrations of his will in anſwer to our praiers.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, In that <hi>Job</hi> tels us, <hi>He would not believe,</hi> &amp;c. we are taught,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That faith is a neceſſary ingredient in praier.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This negation of his faith in praier, implies the need of faith in praier. When I pray I ſhould believe, but as my caſe ſtands I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe, clouds and darkneſſe are upon me. Faith is the ſtrength of praier, <hi>Whatſoever ye ask in praier believing, ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> Mat. 21.22. Praier without faith, it is like a Gun diſcharged without a bullet, which makes a noiſe, but doth no execution; we may put out a voice in ſpeaking, but except we put out faith in ſpeaking, we doe but ſpeak, we doe not pray. As the Word of God comming upon us doth us no good, prevails not upon our hearts, unleſſe it be mixed with faith (Heb. 4.2.) <hi>The word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</hi> So the word that goes out from us, the word of praier, prevaileth not at all with God, obtaineth nothing from him, unleſſe it be mixed with faith; All the promiſes are made to believers, <hi>All things are poſſible to them that believe</hi> (Mar. 9.23.) <hi>Ask in faith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wavering, for he that wavereth is like a wave of the ſea, driven with the winde and toſſed</hi> (Jam. 1.6.) To ask in faith, is to ask, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting upon the power of God, whereby he is able, upon his truth,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:51057:140"/> whereby he is faithfull, and upon his goodnes in Chriſt, whereby he is ready to make good his promiſes. He that asks thus doth not waver. Few are without doubting, but all ſound believers are without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering. The Greek word ſignifies to queſtion, or diſpute a thing, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree beyond doubting; as when a man is at no certainty with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, being ſometime of one minde, ſometime of another. The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being ſo carried, that the man is at variance with his own breſt, or is between two vvaies, not knowing vvhich to take. We tranſlate the word (in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> verſ. 20.) by ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Abraham ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbelief.</hi> The ſimilitude vvhich the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> uſes, illuſtrates this ſenſe, <hi>He that wavereth is like a wave of the ſea,</hi> vvhich by tempeſtuous vvindes is ſometimes carried up to heaven, and anon down to the deep. A man vvho is toſſed with ſuch vvaves of unbelief, ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers like a drunken man, in his practice and profeſſion; he is now on this ſide, to morrow on that; he doth not only ſtagger or halt in his vvay, but he ſtaggers and halts between two vvaies, and is therefore called (verſ. 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>) <hi>A double minded man;</hi> The praiers of ſuch a man are faithleſſe praiers, and therefore fruitleſſe prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Let not that man think he ſhall receive any thing</hi> (unleſſe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, and a deniall) <hi>of the Lord</hi> (verſ. 7.) There are no promiſes made to ſuch, and therefore no mercies convaied to ſuch. Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving praier is gaining praier; yet they vvho believe leaſt, preſume moſt. Hence the Apoſtles check, <hi>Let not that man thinke;</hi> as if he had ſaid, I know ſuch vvill flatter themſelves into a perſwaſion of great matters; They will have high thoughts, but they ſhall receive nothing.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve, Fourthly, <hi>That how ſtrongly ſoever a godly man acts faith, for the anſwer of his praiers, yet he hath no faith that his praier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves an anſwer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I would not believe that he had hearkned to [my] voice.</hi> Chriſt calleth the Spouſe to praier (Can. 2.14.) <hi>Let me ſee thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, let me hear thy voice, for ſweet is thy voice, and thy countenance comely.</hi> Chriſt loves praier. <hi>The praiers of the Saints upon earth, are muſick in heaven.</hi> That invitation to the Spouſe, <hi>Let me hear thy voice,</hi> ſeems to be an alluſion to thoſe, vvho loving muſick, call upon a friend vvho hath a good voice, or exquiſite skill to play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an inſtrument, <hi>Come, ſing us a ſong, play us a leſſon, let us have a fit of mirth.</hi> Thus, I ſay, Chriſt ſpeaks to the Church, <hi>Come, let me hear thy voice, 'tis ſweet, I know thou haſt a ſweet one.</hi> But
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:51057:140"/> the Saints judge their own voices harſh and unharmonicall, they are apt to thinke their praiers, jarrings and diſcords, at the beſt but a rude noiſe, not a compoſed air in the ear of God. Faith makes our praiers melodious, becauſe it carries us out of our ſelves. A believer lives not in the ſound of his own praiers, but of Chriſts interceſſion. What are vve that vve ſhould expect any acceptance upon our own account? or ſay this <hi>We</hi> have gained, this <hi>We</hi> have obtained, thus God hath heard <hi>us,</hi> or thus vve have vvreſtled it out vvith God? As when we have performed all our duties, we muſt ſay, <hi>We are unprofitable ſervants;</hi> ſo when we have obtained all our ſutes, we muſt ſay, <hi>We are unprofitable petitioners;</hi> I will not believe that God had hearkned unto <hi>My</hi> voice. What's mans voice, that God ſhould hear it?</p>
                     <p>Obſerve, Fifthly, <hi>That a godly man ſometimes cannot believe his praier is heard, when it is heard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though he cals and God anſwers, yet (like <hi>Job</hi>) he believes not that God hath hearkned to his voice; He cannot think his praier is heard, though one ſhould come and tell him it is heard. When the Jews returned from <hi>Babylon,</hi> the mercy was ſo great,<note place="margin">Forſan hoc di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, quia ſaepe prae nimia lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titia non credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus verum eſſe quod maxime verum eſſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamus. <hi>Druſ.</hi>
                        </note> that they could not believe they had it, when they had it; <hi>When thou didst turn our captivity, we were as them that dream</hi> (Pſal. 126.2.) The deliverance was incredible, they could not thinke they vvere delivered. Their return to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ſuſpected for a dream of it in <hi>Babylon.</hi> The Church praied vvithout ceaſing for <hi>Peter,</hi> vvhen he was in priſon (<hi>Act.</hi> 12.5.) yet when the Lord brought him out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and he vvas knocking at the door of the houſe where they were aſſembled, while they vvere knocking at the door of heaven for his deliverance, yet they would not believe the report of the damoſell, who ſaid he ſtood before the gate; They tell her ſhe is mad, &amp; vvhen ſhe affirmed it with ſobriety, as well as vehemency, then, they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother help for their unbelief, <hi>It was not Peter, but his Angel.</hi> Thus it is to this day with the Saints, in their great perſonall ſutes and petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both about ſpiritual things and temporal, they are ſo overcome, aſtoniſhed and amazed at the goodneſſe of God, that though they ſee the thing done, yet they can ſcarce believe it is done. As if a Prince ſhould ſend a meſſage to a poor man by ſome great Lord, and tell him he hath beſtowed honour and favour upon him, the poor man is ready to ſay, I cannot believe it: the bleſſing is too big for him to digeſt, and let down into his narrow heart; no, ſaith he, ſure it is not ſo. Though the people of God ever preſerve a
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:51057:141"/> high reſpect and eſteem of the works of God towards them, yet their faith is often below his workings, and they cannot receive or take in mercy ſo faſt as it commeth; faith widens the veſſels of the ſoul to receive much, but God can pour in faſter then faith can wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the ſoul to receive.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Obſerve, <hi>Faith hath it's decaies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Faith doth not keep up alwaies at the ſame height, in the ſame plight and degree: There is a faith which believes that God doth anſwer before he anſwers; and there is a faith that cannot believe God will anſwer, when he hath anſwered. Faith in ſtrength pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the anſwer of God. As God in anſwering ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents our askings (Iſa. 65.24.) <hi>Before they call I will anſwer, and while they are yet ſpeaking I will hear:</hi> So faith ſaith, <hi>Before the Lord giveth, I know I have it, before the Lord doth this thing, I ſee it is done.</hi> Faith in it's ſtrength realizes the mercies of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have a being, and is an evidence to us of what we ſee not. When mercies are but in their principles, in their conception and birth, or at moſt when they are but in their cradle and ſwadling-clouts, faith ſpeaks as gloriouſly of them, as if they were fully acted and grown up before the eye. Strong faith in God (like God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) quickens the dead, and calleth thoſe things which be not, as though they were. Weake faith deadens the quick, and calleth thoſe things which are, as if they were not. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were no ſooner over the red ſea, but they believed themſelves in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> (Exod. 15.13, 14, 15.) and in their Song tell the ſtory of the ſubmiſſion and fears of the uncircumciſed Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons round about, which yet their after unbelief kept off fourty years.</p>

                     <p>But generally the word is render'd a <hi>Tempest;</hi> and thus God is often deſcribed contending with man, (Nah. 1.3.) <hi>His way is in the whirlwinde, and in the ſtorm, and the clouds are the duſt of his feet;</hi> that is, He ſends ſtorms and whirlwindes, by theſe he afflicts the children of men; and as an army of horſmen, raiſes clouds of duſt from the earth with their feet: ſo the Lord raiſes the duſt of clouds with his, <hi>Behold, a whirlwinde, or a tempeſt of the Lord is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwinde; it ſhall fall grievouſly upon the head of the wicked,</hi> Jer. 23.19.</p>
                     <p>To break with a tempeſt, or with a whirlwinde, implies two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A ſudden and an unexpected affliction. Tempeſts are never welcome, and but ſeldom looked for: When the ſea is ſo calm and ſmooth that you may throw a die upon it, a ſtorm ariſeth in a moment, and the veſſell in danger of a wreck.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It noteth the fierceneſſe and violence of an affliction. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts are the moſt violent motions, they come with power. A tempeſt is irreſiſtible, Who can ſtand before it? Who can contend with ſtorms and windes? When the Lord made totall conqueſts of his enemies, he contended (in the letter) by ſtorms and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts. As in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and in the firſt of <hi>Samuel</hi> (Chap. 7.10.) <hi>When the Philistines drew neer to battell againſt Iſrael, the Lord thundered with a great thunder that day upon the Philiſtines and diſcomfited them.</hi> The ſtory is famous of a legion of Chriſtian ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, called the <hi>thundering legion,</hi> becauſe by praier they obtained a refreſhing rain for the army in which they were commanded, and a terrible ſtorm of thunder and lightning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The word is uſed figuratively in warre, when beſiegers comming to a Town or Fort are reſolved to carry it preſently what ever it coſt them, they are ſaid <hi>to ſtorm the place, or to get it by ſtorm.</hi> The Prophet alludes to this (Iſa. 25.4.) <hi>When the blaſt of the terrible ones is as a ſtorm against the wall;</hi> that is, when their rage ſhall be at the higheſt, moſt violent and impetuous, then the Lord will be a <hi>refuge from the ſtorm.</hi> The ſame God who ſaves many from the ſtorms of man, did himſelf ſtorm <hi>Job.</hi>

                     <p>Doe not thinke your praiers are loſt, becauſe your afflictions are not removed, or that God doth not hear you,<note place="margin">Quaedam non negantur, ſed ut congruo tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re dentur, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runtur. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                        </note> becauſe he doth not preſently relieve you. God forbears, when he doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. He anſwers to our profit, when he anſwereth not to our feeling. He anſwereth to our ſpirituall intereſt, when not to our corporall. The ſick man calleth to the Phyſician to take away the bitter, loathſome potion;<note place="margin">Exaudit ſaepe ad profectum, licet non ad vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. <hi>Aquin.</hi> in loc, Saevitur in vulnus, ut homo ſanetur. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                        </note> and the wounded man calleth to the Chyrurgion to take away thoſe corroding plaiſters, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear thoſe torturing operations. But the one gives him his potion, and the other lances his ſores, and laies corroſives to his fleſh; both theſe, while they vex the patient, anſwer him: for what's the reaſon, why the patient would have his bitter potion taken away? is it not becauſe he would be better? And why would he have thoſe painfull operations forborn? is it not becauſe he would have eaſe: Now, for thoſe very reaſons the Maſters of thoſe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions keep him to both; neither could they give him his deſire, but by doing contrary to his will. Thus alſo the Lord is healing us, when we think he is only wounding us, and fulfilling our deſires, while we cry out he is croſſing them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve, <hi>Even while we are praying, the Lord may be thundering, he may be breaking us when we are beſeeching him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We muſt learn to keep to our duty, whatſoever the dealings of God be; whether it be fowl weather or fair, pray ſtill; whether it be ſtorm or calm, go on in praier ſtill. Pray ſtill, though God break ſtill. It is our duty to pray, and it is Gods priviledge to break.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Obſerve from the loftineſſe of the language.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Lord laies very ſore afflictions upon thoſe that are very dear to him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> expreſſeth his afflictions by <hi>breaking with a tempeſt. Strokes from the clouds are most terrible.</hi> The ſame afflictions and ſcourges which he laies upon his enemies, he laies (in the matter, yea, and often in degree) upon his beſt friends. What can the Lord doe to his greateſt enemies, but break them with a tempeſt? He doth not only chaſten with a rod, but ſometimes ſcatter with a ſtorm; He hath not only a ſword, but a thunder-bolt for his ſervants, He hath terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtroaks and blows for them, who lie in his arms, and live in his embraces. Therefore we cannot diſtinguiſh men by the matter, no nor by the meaſure of their afflictions; That which is a judgement to one, is but a chaſtening to another, with the ſame weapon he wounds a friend and deſtroies an enemy.</p>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:51057:143"/>
                     <p>Fourthly, Obſerve, <hi>That afflictions continued cauſe us to ſuſpect that our praiers are not anſwered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Why doth <hi>Job</hi> thinke that God hearkned not to him? <hi>I would not believe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that God had hearkned unto my voice; why? becauſe ſtill he continues to break me.</hi> Faith is put hard to it at ſuch a time;<note place="margin">Licet Deus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rè exaudiat, tamen homo in miſeriu conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> and this is the thing which ſtumbled <hi>Job,</hi> he could not tell how to make it out, that God had heard his praier for him, becauſe he heard ſo great a noiſe of tempeſts and ſtorms againſt him. It is very difficult for faith to ſee mercy thorow clouds of trouble. It is a hard thing for faith to look upon the pleaſed face of God tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a lowring tempeſt, or to believe the calmnes of Gods heart to us in troubleſome diſpenſations. Therefore he ſpeaks here as if his faith were even maſter'd. The providences of God are often too hard for man. And with this temptation Satan helps on unbelief. If he come to a ſoul in affliction, which keepeth cloſe to his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts in Chriſt; <hi>Yea</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you may doe ſo though afflictions were upon you, but yours are more then afflictions, yours are tempeſts and ſtorms: God dealeth with you as with an enemy, yours are no ordinary matters, yours are like the portion he gives to thoſe he hates; I would not weaken your faith, becauſe of a chaſtening rod, but you are beaten with ſcorpions, and will you ſtill believe?</hi> Can God love you and deal thus with you? Thus the ſerpent whiſpers in thoſe louder tempeſts of affliction.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Obſerve, That</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Afflictions continued cauſe us to ſuspect that our praiers ſhall not be anſwered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo I finde ſome rendering the former verſe in connexion with this, <hi>If I have called, and he hath anſwered me, yet will I not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he will hearken to my voice.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I know God hath heard me heretofore, but I fear he will hear me no more; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I finde his hand ſo heavy upon me. Surely then, he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to be gracious, and hath ſhut up his tender mercies. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer experiences can hardly keep faith whole, while we are under preſent breakings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If we take the words, as importing a calling to God for anſwer in a way of provocation (as was ſhewed before) then the ſenſe is; <hi>If I had an ambition to contend with God, and he had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me, by condeſcending to that courſe, yet I could not believe he had hearkned to my voice,</hi> that is, I could not believe that he had yeelded the cauſe to me; why? becauſe he goes on ſtill to break
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:51057:143"/> me with tempeſts; he follows me with trouble ſtill; he ſhews he hath done me no wrong in my former afflictions, by his going on to afflict me ſtill, he is ſo farre from acknowledging the leaſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in what is paſt of my ſufferings, that I ſuffer more, <hi>He breaks me with a tempeſt, and</hi>

                        <hi>To multiply wounds]</hi> notes, numerous and manifold afflictions; many in number, and many in kinde. <hi>Iobs</hi> were deep, deadly wounds, and he had many of them, he was all over wound, body and ſoul were wounds, he was ſmitten within and without; <hi>as to multiply to pardon,</hi> is to pardon abundantly (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7.) So to multiply wounds, or to multiply to wound, is to wound abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</p>
                     <p>Here a Queſtion would be reſolved, How the juſtice of God may be acquitted, in laying on and multiplying afflictions <hi>without cauſe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall referre the Reader for further light about this point to the third verſe of the ſecond Chapter, where thoſe words are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; <hi>Thou movedſt me againſt him to deſtroy him without cauſe;</hi> yet take here three conſiderations more, by way of anſwer to the doubt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Whatſoever the Lord wounds and takes from any man, he wounds and takes his own. <hi>He is Lord over all.</hi> Our health and ſtrength are his, our riches are his; <hi>The world is his and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it</hi> (Pſal. 50.) <hi>If he be hungry he needs not tell us;</hi> he can goe to his own ſtore. It is no wrong to diſpoſe what is our own, whereſoever we finde it. That rule is as true in revocations, as diſtributions: <hi>Friend, I doe thee no wrong</hi> (Mat. 20.15.) <hi>Is it not lawfull for me to doe what I will with mine own?</hi> Though there were no ſinne in man, yet there were no injuſtice in God, becauſe he takes nothing from us, but what he gave us, and hath full power to recall, and take away.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Suppoſe man could ſay, that, what he had were his own, that, his riches were his own, that, health and ſtrength of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy were his own, yet God may take them away, and doe no wrong. It is ſo among men, <hi>Kings and States</hi> call out their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to warre, and in that warre their wounds are multiplied without any cauſe given by them: They gave no occaſion vvhy they ſhould be appointed to ſuch hazards of life and limb, to ſuch hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of hunger and cold; yet there is no injuſtice in this. When God caſts man into trouble, he cals him out to his ſervice, he hath a vvarre, ſome noble enterprize and deſign to ſend him upon. <hi>To
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:51057:144"/> you it is given to ſuffer for his ſake</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29.) he puts it among the ſpeciall priviledges, vvhich ſome Saints are graced vvith, not only above the vvorld, but above many of the Saints, <hi>To whom it is given</hi> (and that's a royall gift) <hi>only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> Now, if in proſecuting this ſuffering task, whether for Chriſt, or from Chriſt, a believer laies out his eſtate, credit, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or life, he is ſo farre from being wronged, that he is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thouſands are ſlain in publike imploiments, who have given no cauſe to be ſo ſlain. If according to the line of men, this be no injuſtice, much leſſe is it injuſtice in God, who is without line, himſelf being the only line and rule to himſelf, and to all beſides himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I may anſwer it thus, Though the Lord <hi>multiply wounds without cauſe;</hi> yet he doth it without wrong to the wounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wounds with an intent to heal, and takes away with a purpoſe to give more; as in the preſent caſe, God made <hi>Iob</hi> an amends for all the wounds, whether of his body or goods, good name or ſpirit. Now, though it be a truth in reſpect of man, that we may not break anothers head, and ſay vve vvill give him a plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or take away from a man his poſſeſſion, and ſay vve vvill give it him again, yet God may. Man muſt not be ſo bold vvith man, becauſe he hath no right to take away and vvound, nor is he ſure that he can reſtore and heal; but it is no boldneſſe, but a due right in God to doe thus, for he as Lord hath power to take away, and ability to reſtore. And he reſtores ſometimes in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, as to <hi>Iob,</hi> but alwaies to his people in ſpirituals and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. Hence the Apoſtle argueth (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.) <hi>Our light afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are but for a moment, work for us an eternall weight of glory.</hi> Afflictions vvork glory for us, not in a vvay of meriting glory, but in a tendency to the receiving of glory, and in preparations for it. <hi>There is no wrong in thoſe loſſes by which we are made gainers: Thoſe loſſes being ſent that we may gain, and the ſender of the loſſe being able effectually to make us gainers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>He multiplieth my wounds without cauſe.</q>
                     <p>Hence obſerve, Firſt,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Afflictions are no argument that God doth not love us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the Lord hath a multitude of mercies in his heart, ſo a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of afflictions in his hand; and a multitude of afflictions may conſiſt vvith a multitude of mercies. At the ſame time vvhen vve
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:51057:145"/> are viſibly encompaſt about, and beſieged vvith an army of ſorrows and oppoſers, an army of inviſible comforts, and protectours may be encamping round about us: As <hi>Eliſha</hi> aſſured his ſervant, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.17.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, (Which I ſhall but only name, becauſe I have met it heretofore.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Lord is not accountable to any creature for his actions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He multiplieth my wounds without cauſe,</hi> or, <hi>He multiplieth my wounds without ſhewing cauſe.</hi> God is the only Judge, who may give ſentence without hearing parties, or ſhewing cauſe. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous in an earthly Judge to doe ſo; he muſt not judge a man to any ſuffering, and not ſhew reaſon of his judgement. But the firſt cauſe needs not ſhew ſecond cauſes. God hath the reaſon of all things in himſelf, and therefore we cannot call him to give his reaſon. Where the will of the Agent may lawfully be all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his actions, there is no reaſon he ſhould give any account of his actions, but vvhat himſelf wils.</p>

                        <hi>Bitterneſſe</hi> is put for the extreameſt affliction, and in the plurall (as here) for all afflictions; <hi>Surely the bitterneſſe of death is paſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Agag</hi> (1 Sam. 15.32.) that is, I have eſcaped bitter death at this time; the ſouldier ſpared me in the heat of the battell, ſurely then a Prophet will not ſlay me in cold bloud. <hi>To be filled with bitterneſſe</hi> notes abundance of afflictions. As to be <hi>filled with the Spirit, to be filled with the fulneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. note the plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full receiving of the Spirit, and of the grace of Chriſt. To taſte of a bitter cup, to ſip a little of it is unpleaſant, but to drinke large draughts, to be fild with bitterneſſe, who can abide it? When Chriſt was come to <hi>Golgotha, They gave him vineger to drinke mingled with gall;</hi> but (though he drank up that cup of his fathers wrath to the very bottom, though he drank up all the gall and wormwood of ſinne, for the ſalvation of men, yet) when he had taſted thereof, <hi>He would not drink</hi> (Mat. 27.34.) If it be grievous to taſte but a little of a bitter cup, then judge how grievous <hi>Iobs</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were, who was filled with bitternes; he had his belly full of trouble, his belly full of <hi>Gall and Wormwood,</hi> his ſtomack could hold no more, bitterneſſe was both his meat and drink.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, they have not only a bitter cup, but bitterneſſe is their cup, and they have not only a taſte of it, but are filled with it. The Pſalmiſt ſhews us a bitter cup, which is the proper portion of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men; <hi>There is a cup in the hand of the Lord, and it is full of mixture, the wine is red, and the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth ſhall wring them out, and drink them</hi> (Pſal. 75.8.) The Lord hath a cup of red wine, that is, a cup filled with wrath, fury and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wicked men (how much ſoever their ſtomacks loath it, and turn againſt it) ſhall drink it up to the bottom, or he will
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:51057:146"/> pour it down their throats, whether they will or no. <hi>They ſhall be filled with bitterneſſe</hi> after all their ſweet morſels and pleaſant draughts. The Saints are filled with bitterneſſe from God, but not with the wrath of God; many ſorrows may be mingled in their cup, but everlaſting love is ever mingled in it. <hi>Saints never drink pure wrath, as wicked men never taſte pure love.</hi>

It follows then, That the Lord is ſo ſtrong that he can doe whatſoever names him ſtrong, and only cannot doe thoſe things, which if he did, he muſt be weak, as was further ſhewed at the fourth verſe of this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Hence it appears, That</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>No creature is able to grapple with God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is ſtrongeſt. The Apoſtle gives that admonition (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.22.) <hi>Doe we provoke the Lord to jealouſie? Are we ſtronger then he?</hi> Surely, except man thought he were able to match God, he would not be ſo fool-hardy, ſo vain, to throw down the Gauntlet, or enter the liſts with God: <hi>The weakneſſe of God is ſtronger then men</hi> (1 Cor. 1.25.) not that there is any weakneſſe in God, but take that which men conceive to be weakneſſe, or weakeſt in him, that's ſtronger then man. Or, <hi>The weakneſſe of God,</hi> that is, the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:51057:148"/> weakeſt inſtruments which God uſes are ſtronger, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, then the ſtrongeſt which men uſe. God can doe more with ten men, then man can doe with an hundred. The moſt ſtammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tongue and flatteſt language ſhall perſwade more, if God ſpeak with it, then the moſt fluent tongue and ſparkling O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory ſpoken meerly by man, <hi>If I speak of ſtrength, loe, he is ſtrong!</hi>

No, <hi>If of judgement, Who ſhall ſet me a time to plead?</hi> As I cannot deal with God at the ſword, or in the field; ſo neither can I deal with him at the bar, or at the judgement ſeat.</p>
                     <p>There are two words in the Hebrew which are uſed for judging.<note place="margin">

And that word (in ſtrictneſſe) ſignifies to give doom or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in a cauſe. The other word is that in the text, <hi>Shaphat,</hi> which ſignifies more eſpecially the doing of right, or the righting of a man in any controverſie.

                     <p>Judgement is taken three waies.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, For the rule of judging, or for the Law whereby we judge. It is ſaid (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.25.) that <hi>Samuel</hi> (after he had anointed <hi>Saul</hi> for King) <hi>told the people the manner of the Kingdom, and wrote it in a book: this manner of the Kingdom</hi> was not the common practice and cuſtom of the Kingdom, but (it is the word of the text) the <hi>judgements of the Kingdom,</hi> that is, thoſe rules and laws by which the Kingdo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> ought to be governed and judged.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Judgement is put for an ability or fitneſſe to judge, to diſcern and weigh things, to ſcan a cauſe, and try out the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt truth of every circumſtance: judgement is the ability of the perſon judging. And</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Judgement is taken for the ſentence given upon the perſon judged, after the evidence of his cauſe is heard and taken. Judgement in this third ſenſe is the reſult of the former two. For when by judgement, as it is the rule of judging, and an ability to judge, the Judge hath wrought and tried out what the merit of a
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:51057:149"/> mans cauſe, and the truth of a buſineſſe in controverſie is, then the iſſue of both is, <hi>Judgement in this third ſenſe;</hi> that is, an act which is paſſed, or a ſentence pronounced upon the perſon that ſtandeth in, or the cauſe which is brought to judgement.</p>
                     <p>So, <hi>If of judgement,</hi> is, If I bring forth my cauſe to be tried by the abilities of the Judge, and by the rule of the Law, this will be no relief to me, I ſhall be in as ill a caſe, as if I were to deal with God by plain ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>There is an opinion that takes in a fourth ſenſe about this word <hi>judgement,</hi> as if judgement were not <hi>a forenſicall, or a judiciall term</hi> in this text, but ſignified only afflictions or puniſhments upon a people or perſon.<note place="margin">Iulicium ſumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur hoc loco pro divinis operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, humarum captum excede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tibus, non pro forenſi &amp; judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciali actu. <hi>Olymp.</hi>

The Lord had juſtified him, the Lord ſaid that he vvas a perfect man (that's the next expreſſion, <hi>If I ſay, I am perfect, it ſhall prove me perverſe.</hi>) The Lord had ſaid of <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 1. <hi>That he was perfect and upright, one that feared God and eſchewed evil;</hi> Why may not <hi>Job</hi> ſay as much of himſelf, as the Lord had done?</p>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:51057:151"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Solomon</hi> reſolves this Query (Prov. 27.2.) <hi>Let another man praiſe thee, and not thine own mouth, a ſtranger, and not thine own lips.</hi> Man muſt not ſpeak the evil he knows by others, unleſſe called, nor the good he knows by himſelf. To ſpeak good of our ſelves vvith our own mouths, is much like doing good by other mens hands. We muſt not act things praiſe-vvorthy by <hi>proxie</hi> but it is beſt to be praiſed by <hi>proxy</hi> for our good acts. Now as man may not praiſe himſelf, though other men may praiſe him: So he muſt not praiſe himſelf, though God praiſeth him. <hi>Not he that commendeth himſelf is approved, but he whom the Lord commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.18.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Why doth <hi>Job</hi> ſay here, I vvill not juſtifie my ſelf, I vvill not ſay I am perfect? Whereas in other places he juſtifies himſelf, and ſaith that he was perfect; if you read the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapters of this book, you ſhall finde them to be but a continued juſtification of himſelf, or a <hi>manifeſt of his own innocency.</hi> There he proclaims how holy he had been, and how righteous in all his waies, that he had put on judgement as a robe, and juſtice as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adem, that he had delivered the oppreſſed, and diſtributed of his fulneſſe to the neceſſities of the poor.

                        </note> while <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, He will not juſtifie himſelf, or ſay, he is perfect, he declines the plea of perſonall righteouſneſſe, or perfection in the ſight of God, as hath frequently appeared in this argument. But in thoſe Chapters and in other places where he is upon his defence; he ſpeaks only in reference to the charge of his friends; As if he had ſaid, <hi>Ye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me for an hypocrite, and cenſure me deeply, I can juſtifie my ſelf, and plead my innocency with you, though I have not a word to ſay for my ſelf before the Lord; I will bear any thing at his hands, let him ſay of me, and doe with me what he pleaſeth, I will take ſhame to my ſelf, and give him glory; but as for you my friends, I will justifie my ſelf in your ſight, I am not the man ye take me for.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe ſpeakings are not croſſe to each other, but helps us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Jobs</hi> ſenſe in this argument. He ſtands much upon his integrity, but it is to his friends; he humbles himſelf in the ſight of his own vileneſſe, but it is to God. <hi>Paul (Rom.</hi> 7.24.) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wails his ſinfulneſſe, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of ſinne and of death!

When we ſee any ſtanding upon their own bottoms, and crying up themſelves, poor ſouls, how are they benighted! How little doe they know of their own hearts or lives! How little doe they know of God! They are in darkneſſe, therefore they ſee not their own ſpots. If a man, whoſe face is foul or deformed ſhould boaſt of his beauty, would you not ſay, this man knows not his own face? Or ſurely, he hath not look'd in a glaſſe to day; May we not much rather ſay to him, who juſtifies himſelf, and ſaith, He is perfect?

Heathens gave us this leſſon, and they ſay it came from heaven, <hi>Know thy ſelf. Auguſtine</hi> is quick upon it, <hi>Lord I know ME, and I know THEE.</hi> To know God and our ſelves is the ſumme of all knowledge. God doth not know him, who knows not himſelf.

The reprovable knowledge of our own ſouls, is not <hi>the knowledge of intuition,</hi> whereby we apprehend what we are,

You ſhall have a ſoul that will know it ſelf into I know not how much pride; many ſtand reflecting upon their own perfections, either externall, how proper, ſtrong and beautifull they are; or internall, how vvitty and eloquent they are, vvhat excellent parts and gifts, vvhat a nimble tongue, vvhat ſound judgements they have, till they loſe Chriſt in this croud of themſelves. This is a dangerous knowledge, a knowledge worſe then ignorance. <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be without knowledge, then know our knowledge thus.</hi> As to reflect upon ſinne, to know our ſelves in our unbelief, vanity and paſſions <hi>&amp;c.</hi> humble us: And a ſoul in confeſſing of ſinne before God, looks long upon his dark part, upon his wants and failings, for this end, that he may be humbled: So to reflect upon our good deeds or graces, to know our ſelves in thoſe adornings of love, patience, humility, faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hazards us upon pride, and ſome ſtand gazing ſo long upon theſe excellencies, that they are lifted up and become very proud.</p>
                     <p>Thus all men who are proud in ſpirituals, <hi>Know their own ſouls,</hi> So <hi>Job would not know his own ſoul.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>He will not know his ſoul in his own perfections. A godly man vvould have God know him in the worſt, but he will not know himſelf in the beſt. He vvould not have a ſinne hid from God, but he vvould hide all his goodneſſe from himſelf. He will know eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good thing before he doth it, but vvhen 'tis done he cares not to know it any more. So the Apoſtle (Phil. 3.8, 9,). <hi>I account, all things but loſſe for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſſe of all things, and doe count them but dung, that I may winne Chriſt, and may be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſſe, which is of the law,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle would not know <hi>Paul</hi> the Phariſee. Legall righteouſneſſe was loſſe to him, vvhen he had found Chriſt: Legall righteouſneſſe vvas dung to him, vvhen he had a ſight of righteouſneſſe by Chriſt.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:51057:154" rendition="simple:additions"/> The Phariſee (<hi>Luk.</hi> 18.) had all upon account, and he hoped to make good gain upon his accounts: he knew how many alms he had given, how well he paid his tithes, and how often he had faſted. He made a ſtock of thoſe things, and put them among his treaſures, which <hi>Paul</hi> made his loſſe, and put among the dung. He that thus knows his own ſoul, hath no true knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>So much of this 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, as it is a ſuppoſition, and hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the vvords fore-going. As it refers to what follows,</p>
                     <p>The words are rendered in the form of a poſition, <hi>I am perfect, I know not my ſoul, I deſpiſe my life.</hi> And ſo divers interpretations are given of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Thus, <hi>I am perfect,</hi> &amp;c. that is, my heart is upright, and I have ever prized and valued mine own integrity at ſuch a rate,<note place="margin">Non novi ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam prae inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritate mea, <hi>i. e.</hi> ea integritate ſum, ut nunqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> animae aut vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae meae ratione abduci potue rim ab integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate mea.</note> that in compariſon thereof, I have not at all regarded, or prized my own life or ſoul, that is, the greateſt comforts and ſweeteſt enjoyments of my life. <hi>My life is but a trifle to my conſcience.</hi> And ſo the meaning is, like that (<hi>Deut.</hi> 33.9.) where the vvord <hi>know,</hi> is uſed in this ſenſe, concerning <hi>Levi, Who ſaid to his father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have not ſeen him, neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor know his own children. Levi</hi> ſleighted all relations, when they ſtood in competition vvith the diſcharge of that duty, vvhich the Lord called him to, he knew neither father, nor mother, nor bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor childe, one nor other, he had no regard at all to them, ſo he might doe the vvill of God. This vvas the commendation of <hi>Levi,</hi> and the priviledge of the Prieſt-hood vvas aſſigned to that Tribe upon this ſervice. Grace vvill not hearken to the cry of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vvhen it hears the call of God. <hi>Job</hi> is conceived to ſpeak here at the ſame rate, as <hi>Levi</hi> did, or higher, <hi>I am upright and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in heart toward God, and ſuch hath my perfection and uprightneſſe been, that I have not known my own ſoul, I have not regarded any ſelf-intereſts, which have ſtood in the way of my obedience unto God, or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice toward man.</hi> His friends charged him, as if he had been a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Judge, or an oppreſſour of the poor; I (ſaith he) am ſo far from valuing vvorldly goods or riches beyond my own integrity, that I doe not value my life to my integrity. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes a like profeſſion (<hi>Act.</hi> 20.24.) His ſpirit was never ſo free and royall, as vvhen he was going bound in ſpirit to <hi>Jeruſalem; The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit witneſſing to him, that bonds and afflictions did abide him in every City. None of theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>move me, neither count I my
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:51057:155"/> life dear</hi> (I will not know my life, let it go vvhich vvay it vvill) ſo <hi>I may finiſh my courſe with joy, and the ministery which I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Lord Jeſus. Paul</hi> vvas none of your poor merchants, who are afraid of their skins. <hi>Pauls</hi> life was cheap in his thoughts, vvhen he vvas to make an adventure for Chriſt; he (as <hi>Job</hi> here) would not know his life, for the omiſſion of a neceſſary known duty, or the commiſſion of a known ſin.</p>
                     <p>This firſt ſenſe yeelds this profitable meditation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He whoſe heart is upright prefers his uprightneſſe before all worldly commodities, and before his own life.</hi>

                        <q>He deſtroieth both the righteous and the wicked.</q>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Therefore I ſaid it.]</hi> That is, becauſe I am of this opinion and judgement, therefore I will not conceal, but bring it forth, and tell you plainly what my thoughts are. The manner of ſpeech, I <hi>ſaid it,</hi> ſignifies a vehement aſſeveration, a liberty and boldneſſe of ſpeech, or a conſtant adhering and ſticking to what hath been aſſerted, I will abide by this poſition as long as I live, I cannot be beaten from it, not becauſe it is my opinion, but becauſe it is a truth.</p>
                     <p>Before I come to the aſſertion it ſelf, obſerve from the preface, <hi>This is one thing,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That truth is ever the ſame, and we ſhould be the ſame in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When a man ſpeaks a thing, of which he is very ſure and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to hold, he ſaith, in our language, <hi>That's once,</hi> that is, I have ſaid it, and I will not unſay it, or eat my words. As <hi>Pilate</hi> when he was deſired to change the inſcription which he had put upon the croſſe of Chriſt, anſwered, <hi>What I have written, I have written,</hi>
                        <pb n="308" facs="tcp:51057:157"/> I will not alter a letter or a title: So a confident aſſertour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, <hi>What I have ſaid, I have ſaid; This is one thing, therefore I ſaid it.</hi> Truth changes not, why then ſhould I, who have born wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to this truth. <hi>Truth muſt be ſtood to.</hi> We have reaſon to ſtick to truth, for truth will ſtick to us; we may ſay it, and ſay it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for it will doe us good again and again. The declarative truth of God is like Chriſt, the eſſentiall truth, <hi>The ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever.</hi> Though it be very old, yet, <hi>it waxeth not old.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And becauſe this in the text was a great truth, the very hinge upon which the whole diſpute between <hi>Job</hi> and his friends turned, therefore he is ſo reſolute in it. Whence note further,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That great and fundamentall truths are to be maintained with much boldneſſe and ſtrength of reſolution.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As it is a good bargain to buy a little truth with the expence of much peace: So it is our wiſdome, as well as our duty, to maintain it with the expence of our peace. They are the worſt ſort of cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards who render up the <hi>Holds of truth</hi> upon compoſition. No tearms honourable enough can be given for the giving up of that. I grant that our peace and lives are richer commodities, then ſhould be hazarded about <hi>trifling niceties, and the crochets of Schoolmen:</hi> but we ought to <hi>contend earneſtly</hi> (and we cannot contend too reſolutely) <hi>for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints</hi> (Jude v. 3.)</p>
                     <p>Obſerve thirdly, <hi>A man that hath got one ſound principle about any point, will from that refute and repell all objections that can come againſt him.</hi>

                     <p>This <hi>Job</hi> affirms againſt <hi>Bildads</hi> aſſertion (<hi>Chap.</hi> 8.20.) who there gives his judgement thus. <hi>God will not caſt away a righteous man;</hi> which (though it may have a true ſenſe, yet <hi>Bildads</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being, that God will not caſt a godly man away in this life, or totally deſtroy him in temporals) <hi>Job</hi> denies, affirming that a godly man may not only be afflicted, but afflicted all his life, and die under that affliction, which in <hi>Bildads</hi> ſenſe is <hi>to be caſt away.</hi> For though <hi>Bildad</hi> did not hold (as <hi>Eliphaz</hi>) that every man who is afflicted, is afflicted for wickedneſſe (he thought a good man might be afflicted for the triall and exerciſe of his graces) yet he was very confident, that God never ſuffered a righteous man to be overwhelmed with affliction: but after fome ſhort, though ſharp aſſaults reſtored him again. And therefore <hi>Bildad</hi> numbred them alſo with the wicked, who were deſtroied as well as affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. This <hi>Job</hi> refutes and argues againſt all along, conſtantly holding the contrary principle, that a godly man maybe ſo afflicted, as to be deſtroied, that he may be utterly and for ever ſtript of worldly comforts. Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Good and bad, righteous and wicked are often involved in the ſame outward evils.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſpiritual eſtate of a righteous man is ſo ſtrong, and ordered in all things, that he can neither totally nor finally fall from it, or loſe it, <hi>Grace is above theſe hazards.</hi> But the temporall eſtate of a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man may be loſt, both totally and finally. Riches, and health and honour, are like themſelves, whoſoever is their maſter, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and periſhing. A righteous man hath a higher tenure of things below, and holds them upon better terms then a wicked man doth; yet he holds them but for a terme, they are not endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſubſtance to him, as not to others. <hi>A little that a righteous man hath is better then the riches of many wicked</hi> (Pſal. 37.16.) But the righteous may be deprived of what he hath, as ſoon as any of the wicked. (Eccleſ. 9.1.) <hi>No man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before him; all things come alike to all, there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; as is the good ſo is the ſinner, and he that ſweareth as he that feareth an oath.</hi> Externals diſtinguiſh not internals. No mans ſpirituall eſtate is knowable by the view of his temporall. <hi>Say to the land of Iſrael, Thus ſaith the Lord, Behold, I am against thee, and I will draw forth my ſword out of his ſheath, (Ezek.</hi> 21.3.) And what will the Lord doe with it? Will he not bath it in the bloud of his enemies, and ſheath it in the bowels of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:51057:158"/> wicked men? he will: but ſhall it be bathed in the bloud of none elſe? The next words reſolve the doubt, <hi>And I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.</hi> It is a terrible ſentence: ſword, famine, peſtilence make no difference of men or manners; they know neither <hi>faces nor hearts.</hi> The beſt in a Nation may taſte the bloudy cup, and feel the cold iron in their bowels, together with the worſt. The <hi>green tree, and the dry tree</hi> may be devoured by the ſame fire, as the Prophet ſhadows good and bad, or, as ſome thinke, good and better, falling into the ſame calamity (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.47.) with which that of Chriſt (<hi>Luk.</hi> 23.31.) ſeems more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The basket of good figs goes into captivity with the basket of evil figs, under which the good and bad among the Jews were typed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.1, 2, 3.</p>
                     <p>But though they fall under the ſame deſtruction, yet their caſe under it is as different, as the perſons are. Faith and holy reaſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh where ſenſe cannot.</p>

But to the point. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet deſcribes it elegantly (Iſa. 30.13.) <hi>This iniquity ſhall be to you as a breach ready to fall;</hi> that is, this iniquity ſhall produce a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhall be to you as a breach ready to fall, <hi>Swelling out in an high wall, whoſe breaking commeth ſuddenly at an instant.</hi> If once a high built wall doe but ſwell, down it comes. <hi>Such a ſwelling wall fell upon, and ſlew twenty and ſeven thouſand of Benhadads ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Army</hi> (1 King. 20.30.) <hi>And ſuch a tower in Siloe fell upon eighteen, and ſlew them</hi> (Luk. 13.4.) The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> at once imprecates and fore-tels a ſpeedy ſcourge upon the gain-ſaying Jews, <hi>Let a cry be heard from their houſes, when thou ſhalt bring a troop ſuddenly upon them,</hi> Jer. 18.22. This hath been the caſe of many among us, who thinking of no danger have been ſurprized by a troop, themſelves made priſoners, and their houſes ſpoil'd in one hour. Such was the condition of our <hi>Brethren in Ireland;</hi> it is almoſt incredible how ſuddenly that ſcourge ſlew them: there was ſcarce a Proteſtant that had ſo much as a ſuſpition of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; nay, ſome would not believe it, when a great part of the countrey was on a flame, and the enemy had butchered thouſands. That ſcourge (if ever any) ſlew ſuddenly the perfect and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. As mercies may come ſo ſuddenly to our ſenſes, that they overcome our faith, ſo may judgements. Some have been ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with mercy (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.4.) <hi>When the Lord turned our captivity as the ſtreams in the South:</hi> that is, <hi>gave us ſudden deliverance</hi> (ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the South, riſe not from a conſtant ſpring, but from acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall raines, which make violent land-floods on a ſudden.) At the approach of this ſudden mercy, the Jews were like to them that dream. So when the Lord ſends ſudden judgements, rivers

If the ſcourge ſlay ſuddenly, He,</hi> that is, the moſt holy and gracious God, <hi>laugheth at the triall of the innocent.</hi> How ſo?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I premiſe this, God doth not laugh or deride properly at the afflictions of his people. No, the Lord is a tender, a gracious and a mercifull father to his people at all times, and moſt tender of them, when they are in their afflictions, when they are in their ſoreneſſe, and in their ſorrows: he is more tender then the moſt
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:51057:161"/> tender-hearted mother (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.15.) <hi>Can a mother forget her ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing childe, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſon of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.</hi> Will a mother laugh and deride a poor infant, when it lies ſprawling and wants her help? No, much leſſe will God laugh at his people: therefore as laughing noteth hard-heartedneſſe, or unnaturall harſhnes of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Lord doth not laugh at his afflicted Saints, it is againſt his nature, againſt his practice and all experience.</p>
                     <p>What is it then he laughs at?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Poſitively, thus, <hi>Job</hi> would here expreſſe that the Lord carries himſelf in outward things, with an equall hand both to the good and to the bad, as was touched before. The Lord laugheth at, and derideth the wicked (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.28.) <hi>I will laugh at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and mock when their fear cometh.</hi> The carriage of God to his own people is ſuch, as if he did mock and laugh at them alſo.<note place="margin">Dicitur ridere, quia ſic judica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hominum vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</note> He that laugheth and derideth at a mans affliction, doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what he ſuffers, he gives him no help, nor delivers him out of his ſufferings. Nay, a man that laugheth at another in affliction, will lay more affliction upon him. Even thus in regard of outward diſpenſations, God deals with his own people, that is, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ones are in affliction and cry unto him,<note place="margin">Ridere dicitur, cum contemnere videtur oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem poſtulantis opem.</note> he makes as if he did not hear or regard them, but lets them lie crying it may be day after day in their pains and wants, yea ſometimes in ſtead of eaſing them, he laies more afflictions upon them; poor ſouls, ſince they ſought the Lord they finde an encreaſe of their ſorrows. God ſeems to deal with them, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> who crying to him for releaſe of their burdens, are anſwered only with, <hi>Ye are idle, ye are idle; let more work be laid upon theſe men, Exod.</hi> 5. Or like <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who threatned his people to make their yoke heavier, while they petitioned he would make it light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and told them of ſcorpions, while they complained of whips. <hi>David</hi> gives us this in his own experience (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2, 3.) <hi>In the day of my trouble I ſought the Lord, my ſore ran in the night, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not</hi> (or, my hand was ſtretched out in praier, and bedewed with tears) <hi>my ſoul refuſed to be comforted (David</hi> ſought for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but his troubles encreaſing, he could not take in the comforts adminiſtred) <hi>I remembred God, and was troubled, I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed.</hi> If any thing in the world can eaſe a troubled heart, thoughts of God can. Thus <hi>David</hi> once relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf, <hi>When the people talked of ſtoning him, he encouraged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:51057:162"/> in the Lord his God</hi> (1 Sam. 30.6.) Yet ſometimes God ſeems to think of us leaſt, when we think of him moſt. A ſoul complaining may be over-whelmed, in ſtead of being helped. Now, he that laies on further afflictions,<note place="margin">Poſt orationes meas, ita me ſemper in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis reliquit, ac ſi me derideret.</note> ſlights and laughs at the former. And this is the firſt way, in which it may be made out, how God laughs at the triall of the innocent. When they complain he doth not preſently relieve them, nay, he laies heavier burdens of affliction upon them, and makes them more matter of complaining, before they have any matter of rejoycing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Deus ex viroru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fortium, <hi>ſc.</hi> pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum conflictu non levem ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit voluptatem.</note>Secondly thus, The Lord is ſaid to laugh, in regard of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <hi>He</hi> takes in the fruits, effects and iſſues of thoſe troubles, wherewith his people are exerciſed: <hi>He laugheth,</hi> not at the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it ſelf, but at the effects and ſucceſſe of it: he knows the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue will be matter of high contentment to himſelf, and benefit to the Saints. He laughs at their triall, becauſe he knows they will honour him in their trials. He laughs not becauſe they are pained, but becauſe himſelf is glorified. As a father who puts a childe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a very hard task, which yet he is aſſured the childe is able to go thorow with, takes content to ſee him ſweat at it, to pant and blow at it: Or, as a Commander in warre, rejoyces when he puts a <hi>party,</hi> of whoſe valour and skill he is confident, upon ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſervice: Though he knows many of them muſt bleed for it, and ſome of them (perhaps) die for it, yet it pleaſes him to ſee ſuch engaged in it. Thus God laughs at the trials and moſt deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate adventures of the innocent, for he ſees they are men who will bide a triall, they will <hi>neither ſhrink in the wetting, nor will their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits conſume in the burning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus a believer is exhorted to laugh at his own triall, <hi>My brethren</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> chap. 1.2.) <hi>count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations or trials.</hi> The more trials, the more joyes. And thus one believer may laugh and rejoyce at the triall of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he knows <hi>that the trial of our faith, being much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then of gold that periſheth, though it be tried with fire, ſhall be found unto praiſe, and honour and glory at the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.6, 7.</p>
                     <p>Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The Lord may bear himſelf toward his own people in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, as if he mockt at their afflictions.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>To ſee good men tried is a delight unto God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laughter is an expreſſion of our inward content and joy. Though the word of the text is ſcarce uſed for laughter in a good ſenſe, yet here it may. The Prophecy ſaith of Chriſt (Iſa. 53.10.) <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him;</hi> God the father was delighted to bruiſe his Sonne, not that he delighted in afflicting or ſtriking him, he was tender and dear to him, as the apple of his eye. But with reſpect to the iſſue and fruit of it, the Lord was pleaſed; <hi>His father laughed to ſee him cast down and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, whom he fore-ſaw conquering and triumphing:</hi> So it is here. A man delights to ſee wreſtlers ſhew their ſtrength, as alſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold men ſtriving for maſteries in fencing or running a race, which are but trials of activity, and contendings for honours. Thus when the Lord bringeth his innocent ſervants into affliction, he doth but bring them to a wreſtling, to a running or a fencing, to ſee how they can make uſe of their hands and legs, how they can make uſe of their ſpirituall armour, how they can weild the ſword of the Spirit, how they can defend themſelves with the ſhield of faith, how they can bear a knock upon the helmet of ſalvation, how they can walk upon thorns and ſharp ſtones, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf having before ſhod their feet with the <hi>preparation of the Goſpel of peace.</hi> This is the ſpectacle which God delighteth in and laughs at, and it is a glorious ſpectacle. The <hi>Roman</hi> triumphs were but childiſh plaies to theſe of the Saints, called out and clad with the armour of righteouſneſſe, which makes them more then Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, over tribulations and diſtreſſe, over perſecution, famine, nakedneſſe, peril and the ſword, yea over principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, over things preſent and to come; The Saints in their trial conquer not only all preſent evils, but all that are poſſible.<note place="margin">Non video quid habeat in terris Iupiter pulchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, ſi convertere animum veli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is the obſervation of <hi>Seneca,</hi> a Roman Moraliſt and Philoſopher, in his book of providence, ſpeaking of ſome of the ancient Worthies of <hi>Rome, I ſee not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what Jupiter hath on earth more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentfull to him, or to which he would rather turn his eye, then to behold Cato ſtanding firm in the midſt of publike ruines, and that, though (after all his wreſtlings, as a noble Patriot for the ſaving of his Countrey) he found both his honeſt counſels broken, and his unwearied labours loſt, yet
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:51057:163"/> he did not loſe his Spirit, nor was his heart broken.</hi> Now, if an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then could ſay, that to ſee ſuch a man conteſt with all manner of troubles, was, he thought, a delight for <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and laughter to the idol-gods: May not we changing the perſons make his ſenſe the comment of this text, and a proof of this obſervation? It is a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delight to the holy God to ſee his faithfull ones, his <hi>Abrahams</hi> in a triall, to ſee his <hi>Jobs</hi> in a triall, his <hi>Pauls</hi> in a triall, to ſee thoſe <hi>Grandees in graces</hi> ſhew ſuch admirable skill, ſuch courage, ſuch zeal, ſuch faith, ſuch patience, ſuch ſubmiſſion of ſpirit, to ſee Saints play the men thus in ſuch ſpirituall trials and hotteſt ſervices, is not this juſt matter of laughing and rejoycing to the Lord?</p>
                     <p>And if the Lord take a kinde of pleaſure in the trials of his Saints, then ſurely the Saints ought not to be diſpleaſed at their trials. Hence the holy Ghoſt bids the Saints laugh, as well as the Lord laugheth, Jam. 1.2. <hi>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations.</hi> Chriſtians, never look upon a triall with ſuch ſad and ſowr faces; the face of God is full of ſmiles to ſee you at it: ſhall that make you ſad, which makes God rejoyce? <hi>Never grieve, but when ye fear ye have grieved God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Further, note, <hi>That the afflictions of the Saints are trials of the Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They are occaſions to ſhew forth their vertues and their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. They give proofs both to God and the world, what manner of men they are. Tried ones are precious ones; many others are ſo, but theſe appear what they are, they have ſhewed their metall. All true faith is good, but tried faith is beſt (1 Pet. 1.7.) <hi>That the triall of your faith</hi> (that is, that your tried faith) <hi>being much more precious then of gold that periſheth, may be found unto praiſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, He laughs at the fears and ſad fore-caſts of his people, who not being able to look thorow ſecond cauſes, and ſee the ends of things in their beginnings; preſently judge all's loſt, the Church muſt be ruin'd, and the Saints undone, becauſe thus tried. Now God knowing the end of all actions, not only at <hi>their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> but <hi>from the beginning</hi> (yea, from eternity) he looking thorow the blackeſt clouds and darkeſt nights, upon the iſſues of all things, derides the ſimple conjectures of men about them. The very Heathens have given us ſuch a notion of God in laughter. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, or</p>
                     <pb n="321" facs="tcp:51057:163"/>
                     <p>Fourthly, God laughs at the laughter, and derides the joies of wicked men, who ſee his innocent ones tried. For they ſay in their hearts, and it may be with their tongues, <hi>Happy we, who have ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped ſuch a ſcouring, we would not have been in their coats for a world: better die then live to bring our ſelves into ſuch troubles.</hi> Or thus, <hi>Now the day is ours, we have prevailed, Theſe men are catcht and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, we ſhall doe well enough with them now.</hi> The Lord hearing ſuch language at the triall of the innocent, laughs, to thinke how thoſe wretches ſhall ſee themſelves deceived, when they ſee theſe who were fallen riſing again, or God by their fall raiſing others, and ſetting his King upon his holy hill of <hi>Sion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, As God laughs at the triall of the innocent; ſo let the nocent and impenitent remember and tremble at it, that God will laugh at the approach of their torments, and mock when their fear commeth, when their fear commeth as a deſolation, and their deſtruction as a whirlwinde.</p>

                        <hi>Job</hi> having thus ſhewed how the innocent are afflicted, ſhews in the next verſe how the wicked are exalted, from both he infers, that there can be no judgement made of any mans inward ſtate, whether he be <hi>innocent or wicked,</hi> upon his outward ſtate, whether he be <hi>proſperous or afflicted:</hi> The innocent are under the ſcourge, and the wicked are upon the throne, and who doth theſe things, but God himſelf? that's the ſum of this 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe.</p>

                        </note>To be given, noteth two things; or there is a double act of giving.</p>
                     <p>There is a gift by providence, and a gift by promiſe. When the Lord is ſaid <hi>to give the earth into the hand of the wicked;</hi> we are to underſtand it of that common providentiall gift, whereby he diſpoſeth of all things to all men; no man hath any thing but by the gift of God. Thus wicked <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had the Kingdome of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> given him, and ſo had hypocriticall <hi>Jehu</hi> for four generations, <hi>They ſerved the providence of God, and the providence of God exalted them.</hi> (Act. 17.26.) <hi>He hath made of one bloud all Nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</hi> that is, he hath (as it were) chalked out, and drawn a line where the bounds and habitations, whither the dominions and poſſeſſions of ſuch men ſhall be extended, and where they ſhall be confined. That's a gift of providence.</p>
                     <p>There is a ſpeciall gift of promiſe peculiar to believers (<hi>Ro.</hi> 8.32) <hi>He that spared not his own Son, but gave him to die for us, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> that is, all worldy things; or we may take in whatſoever elſe concerns our ſpirituall eſtate, beſides Chriſt: All the things of Chriſt, yea and all worldly things come in to the Saints, as a gift by <hi>Chriſt, who is himſelf the greateſt gift that ever man received, or that God could beſtow. How ſhall he
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:51057:164"/> deny us any thing, when he hath given us him who is above all things?</hi> 1 Cor. 3.22, 23. <hi>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or the world, all is yours (for) ye are Chriſts.</hi> Believers enjoy earthly things by an heavenly title. <hi>Chriſt is their conveiance.</hi> In this ſenſe the earth is not given to the wicked: the Lord gives them nothing in Chriſt, or for Chriſt as a Saviour in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Chriſt as a Lord hath bought the wicked</hi> (2 Pet. 2.1.) and he gives them what they have, as they are his creatures: as he hath given them a ſubſiſtence, and a breathing in the world, ſo he allots them maintenance in the world.</p>
                     <p>So then, to receive by donation from God, may note any way of poſſeſſion. What wicked men inherit by ſucceſſion and deſcent from their anceſtours, is a gift of God.</p>
                     <p>Yea, what they get and hold by violence and oppreſſion, is a gift of God. The earth which wicked men tear out of the hands of the godly; the earth which they ſtain with the bloud of lawfull own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they may enjoy it; even this is ſaid to be given unto them by God, in that common way of providence. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was a cruell oppreſſour, yet he had the earth given him by God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.6. <hi>Now have I given all theſe lands into the hand of Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar the King of Babylon my ſervant, and the beaſts of the field have I given him alſo to ſerve him.</hi> God gave him the land, yet <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> invaded it, and got it by violence. God ſent him (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.6.) but he went of his own errand, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. He had no thought of ſerving the will and commands of God, but of ſerving his own ambition and covetouſneſſe: yet of this cruell oppreſſour the Lord ſaith, <hi>I have given him all theſe lands</hi> &amp;c. Thus, <hi>The earth is given,</hi>
                        <q>Into the hand of the wicked.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a queſtion, whom we are to underſtand by theſe <hi>Donees,</hi> or the receivers of this gift? Some expound the text (with a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of the <hi>devil) The earth is given into the hand of that wicked one,</hi>

                     <p>I finde ſome reading the text as an expoſtulation, <hi>Wherefore is the earth given into the hand of the wicked?

                     <p>Secondly, The faces of the Judges are covered by threatnings; Fear of loſſe blindes as well as hope of gain. Some ſend terrible meſſages to the judge; Will not you doe as we would have you? Will not you give your ſentence and opinion thus? at your peril be it. Now the Judges face is covered, his eyes are put out by a threat; the miſt and cloud of a Princes diſpleaſure, of a great mans indignation is before his eyes, <hi>His face is covered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Judges faces are covered by actuall putting them to ſhame, by caſting them out of favour, and clouding them with diſgrace, by taking away their commiſſions, or ſending them a <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi> laying them by as unfit for ſervice; any of theſe is, a covering of the Judges face.</p>
                     <p>There is a fourth way of covering the Judges face, to which the ſecond and third are often made a preparatory. And that is, by putting the judge to death. So much that expreſſion implies in the 40<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this book of <hi>Job,</hi> verſ. 13. where the Lord with infinite wiſdome and holineſſe, inſulting over <hi>Job</hi> to humble him, bids him ariſe, and doe ſome great thing, ſomewhat which might ſpeak him a man of might. <hi>Deck thy ſelf now with majeſty and excellency, and aray thy ſelf with glory and beauty; caſt abroad the rage of thy wrath, and behold every one that is proud and abaſe him, look on every one that is proud, and bring him low, and tread down the wicked in their place, Hide them in the duſt together, and binde their faces in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret;</hi> that is, cover their faces as men prepared for death, as men ready to goe out to execution. We may expound it by that (<hi>Eſth.</hi> 7.8.) where as ſoon as ever the word went out of the Kings mouth, <hi>They covered Hamans face.</hi> And by that (<hi>Mark</hi> 14.65.) where when Chriſt was judged wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, the text ſaith, <hi>They ſpit on him, and covered his face:</hi> The covering of the face was a mark of a condemned man, held as unworthy to behold and enjoy the light of the Sunne, or the light of the Princes countenance. Thus to cover the faces of the Judges is to condemn the Judges, and to take them out of the world by ſufferings, rather then ſuffer them to doe right. I finde that of <hi>Elihu</hi> (Job 34.29.) interpreted to this ſenſe, <hi>When he giveth qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe, who can make trouble?</hi> That is, when the Lord doth abſolve and acquit a man, giving him a diſcharge, then he is free, no man can ſue him or trouble him, much leſſe condemn him; but <hi>if he hide his face, who then can behold him?</hi> So we tranſlate it, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, If the Lord hide his own face. But this expoſition ſaith,

                        <hi>If the Lord hide the face of that man,</hi> that is, If the Lord condemn that man, or paſſe ſentence of death upon him (of which covering or hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the face was a ſymboll) then,<note place="margin">Qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> that they cannot diſcern between cauſe and cauſe. As the Lord hardens the heart and blindes the eye in ſpirituall things, ſo alſo in civil, not by taking away the ſight which man had, but by with-drawing or denying his own light. The Lord covers the faces of the Judges, when he doth not give them light, nor ſhew them the path of juſtice. If God ſuſpend his light, the greateſt lights are preſently in darkneſſe. God doth not hood-winke or muffle up the Judges by putting any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, but by hiding his own eyes from them.

                     <p>Laſtly, (for the clearing of this) The covering of the faces of the Judges, notes three things.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, Covering of the face imports the affected partiality of Judges; many doe as if they could not ſee, as if their faces were covered.

Judges were anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently pourtrai'd or pictur'd, <hi>without hands and without eyes;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands, as noting that Judges muſt not receive or take gifts: And without eyes, becauſe they muſt not ſee friend or neighbour, great or ſmall, kinſman or ſtranger; they were to diſtribute juſtice according unto every mans cauſe, and not with reſpect to any mans ſtate or relation. It is ſaid of Chriſt (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.3.) where his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is deſcribed, that he <hi>ſhall not judge after the ſight of his eyes;</hi> that is, by what appears to the eye, <hi>but he ſhall judge righteous judgement.</hi> In this ſenſe it is the Judges duty and honour to have his face covered. But the covering here meant, is either of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and inability, or of corruptneſſe and partiality.

                     <p>But ſome may object, Shall we attribute this to God? Doth he cover the faces of the Judges? God is pure from all ſinne, while he leaves men in their impurity.

As if he had ſaid, <hi>I thought thou my ſonne</hi> Eſau <hi>hadſt brought me veniſon before, and if it was not thou, I know not who it ſhould be, I was never ſo deceived in my life, if it was not thou.</hi> Such a broken ſpeech <hi>Job</hi> uſes here, <hi>If it be not God who doth theſe things, I am much deceived, for I know not any in the world to whom I might probably aſſign them, but only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. You muſt be wiſer then I, if you finde any thus power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beſides God. If not, where, and who is he?</hi> Whence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That, <hi>The greateſt confuſions in the world are ordered by God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What greater confuſion then this, to ſee the earth given to thoſe who deſerve not to live upon the earth? that they ſhould rule the world who are unworthy to breathe in the world? Yet even theſe things are diſpoſed of by the Lord, and are the iſſues of his counſels, <hi>That wherein we ſee no order, receives order from the Lord.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The very confuſions that are in the world are an argument of the power of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For ſeeing the world continues in the midſt of ſuch confuſions, it ſhews there is a mighty power, balancing theſe confuſions ſo exactly, that they cannot ruine the world, <hi>If there were not an over-ruling power in God, wicked men ruling would ſoon ruine all.

A poſt riding or running, is an excellent embleme of Time. There are many conſiderations in <hi>poſt-riding,</hi> which ſhew how exceeding ſpeedy time muſt be, to which it is here compared.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, A poſt rides upon fleet or ſpeedy horſes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, He rides his horſes upon their ſpeed; a man may have ſpeedy horſes, and goe ſoftly, but a poſt ſpurs on.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A poſt hath change of horſes at every ſtage, that he may keep them upon their ſpeed.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He hath horſes ſtanding ready for change, they are not to fetch out of the field, or to make ready when he comes to his ſtage, it is but leaping into the ſaddle and away.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, He that rides poſt, makes no long meals, much leſſe feaſts, he takes a bit and away.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, He lies not long a bed, he ſcarce goes to bed till he comes to his waies end.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, A poſt hath extraordinary pay for his ſervice, and that will cauſe him to make ſpeed.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, Sometimes he rides upon pain of death, with a halter about his neck. No man will loiter, when his life laies on't.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, If a man rides poſt, all muſt give him way, he picks and chooſeth his path, and no man muſt hinder him.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, He ſtaies not to ſalute, much leſſe like other travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to gaze and view the Countrey, the Towns, buildings, Gardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All theſe things laid together, evince, that the Poſt makes ſpeed. Yet, ſaith <hi>Job, My time out-runneth the poſt,</hi> my time goes faſter then he: The poſt muſt ſtay a little ſometimes, but time will not ſtay at all: The poſt muſt ſtay for change of horſes, but the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of the Sunne never ſtaieth to change horſes (the Sun is the meaſure of time) and that makes no ſtop, hath no ſtages or bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places, <hi>Our daies are ſwifter then a poſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Further, Experiences ſpeak this moſt true of that ſpeciall
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:51057:171"/> time, the time of proſperity. The beſt things of the world are in a moveable, in a paſſing, poſting condition. They ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with us long enough to learn what they are. If a man ride poſt, we can hardly diſcern who he is; the good things of the world, the pleaſures and profits, the <hi>form and faſhion of it paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> ſo faſt, that none can perfectly report what they are, exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting this, <hi>Tranſitory and vain:</hi> As the artificiall faſhions of the world, the faſhions in building and in apparell, paſſe ſo ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that few know what the faſhion is, before 'tis gone; a new one is abroad, before the greateſt number are in the old: So the naturall faſhions of worldly things (ſome in themſelves, all as to our enjoyment) the excellency and dignity, the luſtre and beauty of the creature are out of ſight, before we can well ſay of what colour and ſhape, or what manner of things they were. When the Painter takes the perfect feature of a mans face, or the lineaments of his body, he muſt ſit. The world ſits not ſo long with any man, as for him to take the picture of it. <hi>Creatures pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in their uſing,</hi> while they are in our hands we know not what they are, for even then they are periſhing and declining from what they were. One ſaid, when a creature-comfort was taken from him, If I had it again, me thinks I could enjoy it; we ſeldom enjoy what we have. And what we have is alwaies <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> paſſing from us, while we have it; it is in motion, while in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. We can ſcarce be acquainted with it, becauſe it ſtaies ſo little with us. Hence <hi>Job</hi> concludes this ſimilitude.</p>
                     <q>They ſee no good.</q>
                     <p>My good daies run ſo faſt, that I cannot ſee the good of them. <hi>Not to ſee good,</hi> is, not to have the leaſt experience of good. For the eye takes in it's objects, and judges of them (ſo much Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers teach) ſooner then any other ſenſe. The eye is not long about it's buſineſſe. It is the ſenſe of quickeſt diſpatch. So that it is, as if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, The good things of this life are ſo tranſient, that I am ſo farre from feeling or taſting them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that (which is done with the leaſt delay,<note place="margin">Omnia mihi praerepta ſunt priuſquam ea ſenſerim. <hi>Bez.</hi>
                        </note> and expence of time) I have not time enough to ſee them. When men ride upon ſpeed, or when any thing paſſes ſwiftly before us, we have but a glimpſe, ſcarce a ſight of thoſe objects.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, <hi>To ſee good</hi> is to enjoy good, as was ſhewed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. verſ. 7. And when he ſaith, they (<hi>ſcil.</hi> his daies) <hi>ſaw no good,</hi> his
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:51057:171"/> meaning is, that he ſaw no good in his daies. Till there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency or a fixedneſſe of good, there cannot be a full enjoyment of good. The reaſon why in heaven we ſhall have ſo much happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is, becauſe all the good in heaven is a fixed good. <hi>Time paſſes, but eternity ſtands. Eternity is a fixed Now.</hi> The things of heaven ſhall not periſh in the uſing, nor ſhall the faſhion of them paſſe away. In heaven viſion will be everlaſting, we ſhall ever ſee good, and that ever-ſeeing ſhall be an ever-enjoying of good. Here on earth we ſee God thorow a glaſſe darkly, and we ſee all good in ſuch poſt-haſte, paſſingly, that we rather ſee it not, then ſee it. Eſpecially while we remember that good paſſes by us in the company, yea in a croud of evils, our ſight of it (as when we are called to behold one man riding ſpeedily among many) muſt needs be hindered. Yea oftentimes evils ſtand ſo thick about us, while good poſts by us, that we cannot look tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row them to the good, which is before us. In heaven, as good ſtands to our eye, ſo it ſtands alone, there's no interpoſition of evil to eclipſe the beauty, or darken the ſight of it. There we ſhall ſee, and ſee nothing but good. Here we ſee much beſides, yea ſee either none at all, or very little good, and that but a little.</p>
                     <q>They flee away, they ſee no good.</q>
                     <p>From the Poſt, who runneth upon the Land, <hi>Jobs</hi> next compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon carries us to the motion of a ſhip at ſea, and anon to that ſwifter motion of an Eagle in the air.</p>

Or that God will awake for me, and make the habitation of my righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe prosperous? When as I believe and am very confident that how pure and righteous ſo ever I am, or (by further waſhing and cleanſing, believing and repenting) ſhall appear to be, yet the Lord hath an intent to try me further, even to the uttermoſt, and will caſt me into the ditch, mire and dirt of further afflictions; ſo that they who make up their judgements by your rule, though they were as neer to me as the clothes upon my back, muſt yet abhor, and loath me (as ye my friends now doe) as a wicked perſon.</hi> He ſeems to ſpeak as the Apoſtle doth, 1 Cor. 4.9. <hi>I thinke that God hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles laſt, as it were men appointed unto death, for we are made a ſpectacle to the world, and to Angels, and to men.</hi>

                     <p>And the reaſon why that word which ſignifies the countenance or face, ſignifies alſo anger and wrath, ſorrow and heavineſſe, is, becauſe both anger and ſorrow break forth in the face. If a man be very angry, you ſhall ſee his anger ſcribled in the uneven chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of his countenance: If a man be very heavy and ſorrowfull, you ſhall ſee the lines of ſorrow drawn in his face. Therefore it is ſaid of <hi>Hannah</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18.) when ſhe received a refreſhing and reviving anſwer from the Lord in praier (the poor ſoul ſate
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:51057:176"/> drooping and mourning, as much as praying, but as ſoon as ſhe had a hint of audience and acceptance, it is ſaid) <hi>She went away and did eat, and her countenance was no more ſad;</hi> the ſadneſſe of her heart appeared no more in her countenance, there was fair weather in her face, and Sunne-ſhine in her fore-head, the rain and ſhowres of her tears were blown over and dried up. As in ſome ſinners, <hi>The ſhew of their countenance doth teſtifie againſt them</hi> (Iſa. 3.9.) that is, they are ſo groſſely wicked, that you may ſee ſinne in their faces; whereas others can keep ſinne cloſe enough in their hearts, they can keep the diſeaſe in, and ſhut themſelves up, when they are ſick of the plague of their hearts (1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but holineſſe is diſcernable in the face of their converſation, when nothing but rottenneſſe and corruption lies at the bottome of their ſpirits. But as the corruption of many a mans heart breaks forth in botches upon the face of his actions, and the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe of his ſpirit bliſters upon his tongue in unſavoury ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: ſo thoſe paſſions and affections of the heart, joy and ſorrow, anger and heavineſſe appear in the face, and we may read the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of the heart in the diſguiſedneſſe of a look.<note place="margin">Cordis index vultus, totuſ<expan>

So that, <hi>To leave off heavineſſe, or the face,</hi> is to leave off all ſhew of heavineſſe. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> left off his tears of joy (<hi>Gen.</hi> 43.30, 31.) who, having eaſed his heart of his joyfull ſorrows, by weeping ſecretly in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Waſhed his face, went out and refrained himſelf.</hi> Thus <hi>Iob</hi> would have waſhed his mournfull tears from his face, he attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to refrain himſelf; but he could not, his ſorrows were too ſtrong for him; and as he could not remove, ſo he could not diſſemble them. For this <hi>leaving off,</hi> is to be taken as the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent act of <hi>forgetting,</hi> for an affected, reſolved laying aſide. If I make it my buſineſſe to be chearfull and <hi>leave off my heavineſſe, yet,</hi> &amp;c. Obſerve hence,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sorrow is not eaſily ſhaken off.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sorrow ſticks cloſe. It is very hard for a man to play
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:51057:177"/> the hypocrite with his ſorrow, or diſſemble the ſadneſſe of his heart, but it is farre harder to be really delivered of it. Sorrow is a companion that will not be caſt off with a word. A man may more eaſily cover his ſinne, then his ſorrow. Many can put a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour of holineſſe upon their faces, when nothing but wickedneſſe is in their hearts; but it is not eaſie to make a ſhew of comfort, when nothing but ſorrow is in the heart. Grief will out. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe in the heart, is like <hi>the ointment in the right hand,</hi> of vvhich <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks (<hi>Prov.</hi> 27.16.) <hi>that it bewraieth it ſelf.</hi> One ſaid of a merry <hi>Atheiſt, He laugheth to thee and to me;</hi> that is, he ſeems to laugh, but he mourns to himſelf, the mans heart is heavy. If it be not ſo, yet it may be ſo with all wicked men, when they are merrieſt in the face, they have reaſon to have ſorrow even unto death in their hearts: it is a hard thing (I ſay) to put ſorrow out of the face, much more to get it out of the heart; when it is lodged there once, it will not ſoon be diſpoſſeſs'd. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1.) exhorts, <hi>To lay aſide every weight, and to caſt off the ſinne that doth ſo eaſily beſet us;</hi> he means it of the ſinne of nature, which we bear about us; this ſinne (ſaith he) doth ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily beſet us, but let us caſt it off, that is, let us ſtudy and ſtrive to lay aſide this heavineſſe of ſinne, which is the trueſt cauſe of the heavineſſe of ſorrow. One would thinke that a man needs not much perſwaſion, when he hath an heavy burthen upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to lay it aſide; yet (ſo it is) man can hardly be perſwaded to lay aſide this burthen, and it is the buſineſſe we have with your ſouls every day, to perſwade you to lay it aſide. <hi>It is a weight that eaſily beſets us.</hi> Now as we need much exhortation to caſt off the weight of this ſinne, which is ſo pleaſing, ſo alſo of ſorrow, though it be unpleaſant. When ſorrow beſets us, it leaves us without eaſe, but ſorrow eaſily beſets us. <hi>Iob</hi> found it a hard task to lay aſide his burden.

Here, if I ſay I will comfort my ſelf, <hi>Take heart at graſſe</hi> (as we ſay) and play the man, then my ſorrows renew upon me.</p>
                     <p>But ſome may object; How is it that <hi>Job</hi> takes upon him to <hi>comfort himſelf,</hi> Is it any wonder if <hi>Job</hi> came ſhort of comfort, when he went to himſelf for comfort?</p>
                     <p>Comfort is not a commodity to be found in the hand or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of any creature; the great God hath all that in his own hand; if any man will have comfort, he muſt trade to heaven for it. It is the honour of God to be called, <hi>The God of all comfort</hi> (2 Cor. 1.3.) that is, the God who hath all comfort at his diſpoſe. As ſome Kings have a denomination from the great ſtaple commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of their Kingdoms. Our King is called, <hi>The King of the wooll,</hi> becauſe wooll is the chief commodity, and more plentifull here, then in any Countrey of the world. Another is called, <hi>King of the wines: and another, of the flax. Comfort is the ſtaple commodity of heaven;</hi> and God is called, <hi>The God of all comfort,</hi> not only becauſe the chiefeſt and beſt comforts are in his hand, but becauſe there is not the leaſt imaginable comfort to be had out of his hand. He hath the monopoly of comfort, or rather the ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift of comfort. We can trouble and perplex our ſelves, but God only can comfort us. And <hi>he is the God of all comfort,</hi> of all ſorts and of all degrees of comfort: the God, not only of ſpirituall, but of worldly comfort, of temporall comfort, as well as of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. As the joyes of the holy Ghoſt are in his hand, ſo are the joyes of civil relations; the joy of meat and drinke, the joy of riches and honour are in his hand alſo, How then ſaith <hi>Job, I will lay aſide my heavineſſe, I will comfort my ſelf?</hi> It is a hard thing to comfort others (<hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, <hi>It is as eaſie a work to raiſe the dead, as to comfort the conſcience)</hi> but it is harder for a man to comfort himſelf. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> gave teſtimony to <hi>Job</hi> in the fourth Chapter (<hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4.) that he had <hi>upholden him that was falling, and had ſtrengthned the feeble knees. But now it is come upon thee, and thou fainteſt, it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</hi> Thou, who
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:51057:178"/> haſt holpen others, canſt not help thy ſelf. Yet here <hi>Job</hi> was upon a reſolve to comfort himſelf.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, Though it be a truth, that no man is able to comfort himſelf, no more then he can convert himſelf; and that a man is no more able to change his heart from ſorrow to joy, then he is able to change his heart from ſin to grace; yet, a man may attempt or aſſay, he may uſe means to comfort himſelf. When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will comfort my ſelf;</hi> the meaning is, I will doe the utmoſt I can, I will not be behinde in my endeavours, I will take the beſt courſe, and improve all opportunities to get out of theſe dumps, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will preſcribe me a way, or direct me to a remedy of theſe ſorrows, I will ſubmit to it, <hi>I will comfort my ſelf.</hi> From whence note, That</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>What a man really endeavoureth to doe, that he may be ſaid to doe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I will comfort my ſelf;</hi> Why? Becauſe though he were not able to attain ſuch an end; Joy and comfort lieth beyond the line of the creature, yet he reached at it, he attempted and aſſaied all means to comfort himſelf. Thus the ſalvation of a man is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to himſelf; A man is ſaid to ſave himſelf, though ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongeth to the Lord, even temporall ſalvation, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eternall ſalvation, yet, a man may be ſaid to ſave himſelf; As the Apoſtle (1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.16.) exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to walk by a holy rule, to ſettle himſelf in his ſtudies, to read the Scriptures, and to meditate in them, to be faithfull in diſpenſing of the Goſpel, aſſuring him, <hi>If thou doſt theſe things, thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf, and them that hear thee. Save thy ſelf.</hi> No man can be his <hi>own Saviour,</hi> he may be as well his <hi>own Creatour; Timothy</hi> was thus encouraged, becauſe in ſo doing, he did all that a man ought, who expects ſalvation. That was the way to, though not the cauſe of ſalvation. <hi>Salvation is all Chriſts, yet he who doth his best to ſave himſelf, may be ſaid, to ſave himſelf.</hi> Thus alſo a man comforts himſelf, converts himſelf, inſtructs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he putteth himſelf out to the utmoſt of gifts, graces, and opportunities to doe or attain duties and bleſſings. <hi>No man</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>doth ſtir himſelf up to take hold of the Lord.</hi> The word in the Prophet ſignifies, to awake, or to watch; no man wakes or watches his opportunity to take hold of the Lord. It notes alſo that action of old birds, who flutter with their wings, and beat up their young ones, to urge and provoke them to uſe their wings, and flie abroad. Thus he complained, becauſe the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:51057:178"/> lazy, dull-hearted Jews did not raiſe up and waken their hearts to doe what they could, though to doe it was more then they could.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve, <hi>That a man in affliction may help on his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts or his ſorrows.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I will comfort my ſelf, I will leave off my heavineſſe.</hi> Some adde to their afflictions, and are active to aggravate and encreaſe them: they make their night darker, and obſcure the light of counſell that is brought unto them: they joyn with Satan their enemy, and by the black melancholy vapours of their own hearts, ſtifle the conſolations that are adminiſtred them by faithfull friends. Like <hi>Rachel</hi> (Jer. 31.) <hi>they refuſe to be comforted;</hi> when reviving Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials are offered, they ſpill them upon the ground, and will not take in a drop: they are ſo farre from comforting themſelves, that they will not receive comfort from others. The Prophet ſeems to be reſolved upon the point, he would go on in ſorrows, <hi>Look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from me, I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me</hi> (Iſa. 22.4.) As ſometimes a man under great affliction beſpeaks com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from others, O, I am in a ſad caſe, come, comfort me, ſhew me how I may get eaſe from theſe ſorrows. Many beg praiers, and ſend bils of their afflictions, deſiring to have them ſpread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord in the Congregation, that ſome comfort may be dropt from heaven into their diſeaſed bodies, or wounded ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Others ſleight praiers, and care not to be comforted, as if it were an eaſe to them to mourn, and a refreſhing to be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſſe. There is a two-fold ground upon which comforts are thus put off.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Some put off their comforts upon fullenneſſe of ſpirit; black and dark ſpirits love to bathe themſelves in ſorrow. <hi>Sorrow is the bath of drooping ſpirits;</hi> and it is Satans bath too; Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is commonly called, <hi>The devils bath;</hi> he takes delight to waſh in the ſtreams of our unneceſſary tears. Sorrow for ſinne puts the devil to the greateſt ſorrow. Godly grief is a grief to Satan: but he delighteth in our worldly ſorrows, as the devil may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted: if he have delight in any thing, this is one thing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in, our forbidden ſorrows. Some ſorrows are as much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden as any pleaſures. The devil is as much pleaſed with our unlawfull ſorrows, as he is with our unlawfull pleaſures. And he labours as much to make us pleaſed with them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Others help on their own ſorrows, and leſſen their comforts
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:51057:179"/> through forgetfulneſſe or ignorance; they (as the Apoſtle chides the Hebrews, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.5.) have forgotten the exhortation, which ſpeaks unto them as unto children. Now, as wicked men rejoyce, becauſe they forget or know not their ill condition: So godly men are ſad, when they forget or know not how good their condition is. Yet <hi>Job</hi> ſuppoſes the review of his good eſtate, would neither check his ſorrows, nor eſtabliſh his peace, <hi>If I ſay, I will forget my complaint, I will comfort my ſelf, I am afraid of all my ſorrows.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Obſerve, <hi>Man is not able to comfort himſelf;</hi> we can make our ſelves croſſes, but we cannot make our ſelves comforts. A man may ſay, as <hi>Job</hi> did (<hi>Chap.</hi> 7.13.) to his bed, comfort me; or to his riches, comfort me, or to his wine and good chear, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me, or to his friends, comfort me: He may ſay to all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts of pleaſure, to merry company, and muſick, eomfort me; Yea a Saint may ſay to his graces and holineſſe, comfort me; and yet none of theſe can comfort him,<note place="margin">

                     <p>The root hath a double ſignification. Firſt, To afflict with grief (Iſa. 63.10.) <hi>They vexed his holy Spirit.</hi> Secondly, To fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion or form a thing (Job 10.8.) <hi>Thy hands have made me and faſhioned me round about.</hi> The ſame word by a Metaphor ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies both to grieve and to faſhion, to vex and to form, becauſe a man that forms &amp; faſhions a piece of wood or ſtone, ſeems to put it to pain by cutting and hewing. And he that forms wax, vexes and chafes it in his hands. Thus I ſay, becauſe in the faſhioning of a thing, a man doth bruiſe, cut, and (as it were) put it to pain, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame word ſignifies both to vex or grieve, and to form or faſhion. And this word is applied unto the ill uſage of words (Pſal. 56.5.) <hi>Every day</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> ſpeaking of his enemies) <hi>they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>reſt my words;</hi> or they put my words to pain and grief, or they painfully and grievouſly wreſt my words, <hi>Davids</hi> enemies took up what he ſpake, and put a new ſhape upon it, and this
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:51057:179"/> they did ſo vexingly, that they are ſaid to wreſt his words; a thing is vexed when it is wreſted, or wrought quite out of the form it before had. The ſame Metaphor the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> uſeth in reference to Doctrine, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. ſpeaking of the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul,</hi> in which <hi>are ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned and unstable, wreſt,</hi> or put upon the rack; they painfully form his words, and repreſent them in a meaning which he never intended. What is ſpoken may be right, both in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and intendment of the ſpeaker, yet another wreſts, forms, and faſhions it in his own mould, and makes it bear a ſenſe which the ſpeaker never dream'd of.</p>
                     <p>In this Text we have the <hi>Noun</hi> only, which importeth either the labour or pains, which a man taketh, or the pain and grief, which a man feeleth. Hence in the Hebrew this word ſignifies an <hi>Idol,</hi> and both acceptions fall into the reaſon of it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt. becauſe Idols are made, faſhioned and formed up curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, with a great deal of art and labour: the wax, or clay, or ſtone is put to pain; you muſt cut it and carve it to make an Idol.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe Idols are ſerved, attended and worſhipped with much pain and grief. Falſe worſhip, or the worſhip of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, is alwaies more ſervile and painfull then true worſhip is. Falſe worſhip is a painfull ſervice, a ſervile ſervice, a toil rather then a worſhip; but the ſervice of the true and everliving God, is an holy, an ingenuous, a noble and an honourable ſervice. Idols are troubleſome, both in their making, and in their worſhipping. From this two-fold interpretation of the word, I finde a two-fold tranſlation given.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Thus, <hi>I am afraid of all my works,</hi> as if <hi>Job,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Verehar omnia opera mea <hi>Vul.</hi>
                        </note> having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to comfort himſelf in a reflexion upon his good works, and former holy walkings, feared they would not ſerve his turn, or bear up his ſpirit in the evil day, which was come upon him. As if he had ſaid; <hi>I have lived as exactly by the rule of the Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as I could; I have had respect to all the Commandments of God, that I might not ſinne againſt him. Yet I am afraid of all my works, the anger of God will ſurely ſoak thorow them all, or finde holes and breaches in them to come in upon me at.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus he is conceived reaſoning with himſelf. But doubtleſſe it was not <hi>Jobs</hi> meaning to look to the innocency or holineſſe of his life paſt, as the ground of his preſent comfort; he that would doe ſo, may juſtly be afraid of all his works. When we ſee the beſt of
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:51057:180"/> our ſelves, we have more reaſon to be afraid, then to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. As we muſt work out our ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling: ſo we have cauſe to fear and tremble at our works.</p>
                     <p>But rather as we tranſlate, <hi>I am afraid of all my ſorrows;</hi> that is, I no ſooner endeavour to comfort my ſelf, but preſently my ſorrows throng about me, they appear before my face, and make ſuch a gaſtly apparition, that I am afraid. Sorrows charge and aſſault me afreſh, when I am purpoſing to make an eſcape from the hands of ſorrow. When I think of leaving off my heavineſſe, or of getting out of the ſight of it, ſorrows come upon me with greater violence then before. While a priſoner is quiet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his reſtraint, the keeper laies no great reſtraint upon him; but if he perceive him meditating an eſcape, or attempting to break priſon, and ſet himſelf at liberty, preſently more irons are clapt upon him, and an advantage taken even to load him with chains. Such hard uſage this poor priſoner feared at the hand of his ſorrows, <hi>If I ſay, I will leave off my heavineſſe, I will throw off my bolts and fetters, and get out of theſe troubles, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of all my ſorrows;</hi> I ſhall have all the Keepers and Jailers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me, they will lay more load upon me, and watch me more ſtrictly then before: You tell me I am in love with my ſorrows, but the truth is, fears of ſorrow incompaſſe me round about, <hi>I am afraid of all my ſorrows.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Note hence: Firſt, this generall truth,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That affliction is the matter of fear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Naturall fear ariſes from the apprehenſion of ſome approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil; and as fear grows more boiſterous and inordinate, ſo it repreſents us with ſadder (though but ſuppoſed) evils.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve, <hi>A godly man may be much oppreſt with the fear of afflictions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When I would comfort my ſelf, I am afraid of all my ſorrows:</hi> It is terrible to me to think that they ſtill encreaſe upon me, and that whileſt I hope to eſcape, I am more enſnared. Chriſt himſelf, when he was in our nature, and clothed with our fleſh, was afraid of all his ſorrows: he was <hi>a man of ſorrows,</hi> and he was afraid of his ſorrows too, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.38. He ſaid, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowfull even unto death;</hi> and <hi>he offered up praiers and ſupplications with ſtrong cries and tears unto him that was able to ſave him from death, and was heard in that he feared</hi> (Heb. 5.) His were extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſorrows indeed, ſuch as no creature ever felt or taſted. The
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:51057:180"/> Cup of ſorrow which he drank was mixed and tempered with all our ſorrows, and with the cauſe of them, our ſins. This was it he feared, being in our nature; though as that nature was hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically united unto the divine nature, <hi>it</hi> had infinitely more power to bear all thoſe ſorrows, then we have in our nature to bear the leaſt ſorrow. Now, if Chriſt himſelf in our fleſh was afraid of his ſorrows, which yet he knew he ſhould overcome, how much more may the fear of ſorrows overcome us, while we are in the fleſh?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Obſerve, <hi>That the fear of afflictions aſſaults and oppreſſes ſome moſt, when they ſet themſelves moſt to conquer and overcome them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I, ſaith <hi>Job, would comfort myſelf, but I am afraid of all my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;</hi> I fear they will be doubled and trebled upon me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had rather ſit ſtill, then, by ſtriving to unlooſe, ſtraiten the cords of my affliction faſter upon me. The next clauſe ſeems to hint this as a reaſon, why his ſorrows hung ſo cloſe upon him.</p>
                     <q>I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</q>
                     <p>But how did <hi>Job</hi> know this? As God ſaid to <hi>Adam</hi> (Gen. 3.11.) <hi>Who told thee that thou waſt naked?</hi> So I may ſay to <hi>Job,</hi> Who told thee that God would not hold thee innocent? Or, where hadſt thou this aſſurance of thy condemnation? The Saints may know, or be aſſured that God will pardon them; but a wicked man cannot know, or be aſſured that God will not. This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Job</hi> was but a ſuſpition, or at the moſt a conjecture. And the giving out of this conjecture was but the language of his fear, his faith could ſay no ſuch thing, for God had no where ſaid it, <hi>The beſt men ſpeak ſometime from their worſer part.</hi> Their graces may be ſilent a while, and leave corruption to have all the talk. When the fleſh is under great pain, the ſpirit is hindered from acting its part, and then ſenſe gets the maſtery over faith. Had it not been upon ſuch a diſadvantage, <hi>Job</hi> had never offended with his tongue, by ſaying he knew what he could not know.</p>

                        <hi>I know thou wilt not cleanſe my body from this filthineſſe, from theſe diſeaſes that now anoy me:</hi> And ſo it is an anſwer to the words of <hi>Bildad,</hi> telling <hi>Job,</hi> that in caſe he ſought unto God, and humbled himſelf before him, he would awaken for him, and remove thoſe judgements.

                     <p>Again, Taking it tropically (as we render it) for a judiciall cleanſing or purification; ſo, <hi>Thou wilt not hold me innocent,</hi> is as much as this, Lord, ſuch ſorrows and troubles are upon me, that I fear thou wilt not declare, or pronounce, or give teſtimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me to the world, that I am an innocent perſon. Becauſe the ſores and troubles upon him, were as an evidence againſt him in the judgement of his friends, that he was a wicked perſon, therefore (ſaith he) Lord, I am afraid, <hi>Thou wilt not hold me,</hi> that is, <hi>Thou wilt not declare me to be innocent</hi> by taking away theſe evils,<note place="margin">Non mundabis, <hi>i. e.</hi> purum, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum, vel etiam innocentem non declarabis.</note> that ſo this opinion of my friends concerning me may be removed or confuted.</p>
                     <p>From this ſenſe note:</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The ſoul miſgives ſometimes about the pardon of ſinne, and is even ſwallowed up with deſpair, concluding, <hi>I know God will

                     <p>But eſpecially (which is rather the minde of <hi>Job</hi>) the ſoul miſgives about releaſe from puniſhment. Some being hamper'd in the bands of affliction, conclude, God will never let them looſe, or ſet them at liberty again. Such a concluſion <hi>Davids</hi> unbelief made againſt himſelf, <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of Saul</hi> (1 Sam. 27.1.) When <hi>Jonah</hi> was caſt into the deep, in the midſt of the ſeas, when the flouds compaſſed him, and all the billows and waves paſſed over him, then he ſaid (<hi>Chap.</hi> 2.4.) <hi>I am caſt out of the ſight of thine eyes.</hi> Indeed <hi>Jonah</hi> began to recover quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his next words being a breath of faith, <hi>Yet I will look again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thy holy Temple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve, <hi>That untill fear of guilt be removed, fear of trouble will not remove.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> was not very clear about the pardon of his ſinnes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtuck upon his ſpirit, while he was under the clouds and darkneſſe of this temptation; therefore, ſaith he, <hi>I am afraid of all my ſorrows.</hi> Till the ſoul is ſetled in the matter of pardon, or freedome from guilt, it can never be ſetled about freedome from puniſhment. Hence the Apoſtle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10, 15.) ſpeaking of the Saints before the comming of Chriſt, cals Chriſt, the Captain of our ſalvation, and aſſures us, he took fleſh, that through death, he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and <hi>deliver thoſe who through fear of death, were all their life time ſubject unto bondage.</hi> The language is very near this of the Text, <hi>I am afraid of all my ſorrows.</hi> As <hi>Job</hi> was in bondage under his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions through the fear of his returning ſorrows: So, <hi>they were all their life time ſubject unto bondage</hi> through the fear of approaching death. All the Saints before the comming of Chriſt, were under ſuch a bondage, for the Apoſtle ſpeaks as of a generall ſtate, <hi>That he might deliver thoſe, who through the fear of death, were all their life time ſubject unto bondage.</hi> The reaſon hereof, was, becauſe they had not ſo manifeſt and convincing a light concerning the pardon of ſinne, the freeneſſe of grace, and the abundance of that mercy which was brought in afterwards, and revealed by Jeſus Chriſt, when he actually made our atonement by the bloud of his croſſe: For howſoever it is undeniable, that the faithfull under the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, had knowledge of that ſatisfaction which was to be made by the Mediatour for the removing of ſinne, and the taking
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:51057:182"/> away of guilt (every ſacrifice ſpake this, ſhewing that there was an atonement to be made by ſome other bloud, which the bloud of the ſacrifice typified) yet notwithſtanding there was not a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and a quieting of their hearts, becauſe Chriſt (though in the promiſe ſlain from the beginning of the world) was not actually ſlain, nor offered up for ſinners. The Apoſtle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 2.) argues upon the ſame point, That the Law, with <hi>thoſe Sacrifices, could not make the commers thereunto perfect,</hi> that is, it could not aſſure the heart that ſinne was taken away, <hi>for if it could, then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſacrifices ſhould not have needed to be offered up ſo often.</hi> What needed any repetition, ſeeing they who were once ſo purged ſhould have had no more <hi>conſcience of ſinne,</hi> that is, ſinne ſhould never have troubled and vexed their conſciences any more? But <hi>now Chriſt by one offering hath for ever perfected them that are ſanctified</hi> (verſ. 14.) that is, he hath made a perfect ſatisfaction for them; and compleated the peace of their conſciences. So then, while there remaineth any ſcruple about ſinne, fears of evil will hang upon the ſpirit. And we finde that the old Saints were very fearfull of outward afflictions, becauſe they had as it were a reliſh or taſte of the disfavour and diſpleaſure of God in them. And in proportion as any of them had more or leſſe of free grace appearing to them, ſo they were more or leſſe enthralled with theſe fears. We may obſerve thorow out the old Teſtament, that there was not ſuch a ſpirit of rejoycing in ſufferings and afflictions, as we finde breakings forth in the new. <hi>Paul</hi> never ſaith, <hi>I am afraid of all my ſorrows;</hi> No, he ſaith, <hi>As ſorrowfull, yet alwaies rejoycing.</hi> You never hear him complain of his afflictions. He indeed complains of his corruptions, <hi>O miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death!</hi> But he never ſaid, <hi>O miſerable man, how am I afflicted, I am in deaths often, who ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me from this death of the body!</hi> We finde the Saints under the Goſpel clothed with a ſpirit of exultation and rejoycing, of which we hear little, if any thing at all under the Law: The want of which we are to aſcribe to their want of a clear light about the removing of guilt, and the pardon of ſin, <hi>I know thou wilt not hold me innocent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Obſerve, <hi>That God often deals with his beſt ſervants, in regard of outward troubles, as if they were guilty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I know thou wilt not hold me innocent;</hi> that is, thou wilt not deal with me as with an innocent perſon. As the Lord dealt with his
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:51057:182"/> Son, ſo he deals with his ſervants. God the Father dealt with Jeſus Chriſt as with a guilty perſon (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.9, 12.) He was <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among tranſgreſſours, and made his grave with the wicked.</hi> The Lord reckoned him as a ſinner, while he was ſatisfying his juſtice for ſinne, and making an atonement for ſinners. <hi>Job</hi> is no where called a type of Chriſt, but he was like him, and their parallel might be drawn in many things, eſpecially in this, that both were numbred with the wicked, and in that both were uſed, as if they had been guilty. The diſpenſations of God to his own beloved Sonne once did, and to his faithfull ſervants often doe look like thoſe to the greateſt tranſgreſſours. His Son was handled, ſo that he might redeem ſinners; his ſervants are ſo handled, ſometimes to prevent, often to purge them from ſin, ſometimes to try their graces, alwaies to make them fitter veſſels for glory. Though we cannot make any earnings toward glory by the weightieſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, yet <hi>theſe light afflictions, which are but for a moment, work for us a farre more exceeding and eternall weight of glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall paſſe from this reference of the word, <hi>Thou,</hi> when I have briefly vindicated the text from the corruptions of ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,<note place="margin">

                        </note> who urge it to prove the uncertainty of our juſtification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Job</hi> (ſay they) doubted whether God would declare him juſt or no. I anſwer, Juſtified perſons may have doubts, yet that doth not argue the uncertainty of juſtification. Juſtification is a ſure act in it ſelf, and we may be ſure of it, though ſome are unſetled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. This Scripture gives no ſhelter, much leſſe ſupport to that doctrine of doubting. The Vulgar reading, groſſely varying from the originall, is all the ſhadow it hath in this place. For as that Tranſlatour miſtakes the former clauſe, which he renders, <hi>I am afraid of all my works:</hi> So this later, which he renders,<note place="margin">Sciens quod non parceres delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenti. <hi>Vulg.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Knowing that thou wilt not pardon or spare him that offendeth.</hi> He that ſeeks to be juſtified by his works, ſhall not want fears about his juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: And if this be a truth, which their tranſlation ſeems to hold forth, that God will not pardon him that offendeth, the beſt and holieſt men in the world have reaſon, not only to fear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are juſtified, but to reſolve they can never be juſtified in his ſight. If every man that ſinneth muſt doubt of the pardon of ſinne, all men muſt doubt. In that common acception of the word <hi>offend,</hi> it is falſe, that God will not pardon him that offends: whom ſhould he pardon but ſuch as offend? They who are above ſin, are above pardon. <hi>Job</hi> never thought God would not
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:51057:183"/> pardon him, becauſe he had ſinned, it being one of the royall ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of God, <hi>The God pardoning iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſinne.</hi> But if we take ſinning or offending in a ſtricter ſenſe, as it imports a man obſtinate and ſtill engaged with delight to ſin (in which ſenſe the next title of the Lords great name, after, <hi>Forgiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity, tranſgreſſion and ſinne,</hi> is to be underſtood, <hi>And that will by no means clear the guilty</hi> (Exod. 34.7.) The Hebrew is, <hi>And that clearing will not clear.</hi> We ſupply the word <hi>guilty;</hi> which the <hi>Chaldee</hi> well explains by this periphraſis, <hi>Him that will not convert, or turn to the Lord</hi>) ſuch offenders the Lord will not pardon. But to ſay, that the Lord will not ſpare and pardon ſuch guilty perſons, ſuch delinquents as will not return unto him, but go on to adde one wickedneſſe to another, is no deniall of the Saints aſſurance of pardon, they being already turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and converted to the Lord. So much for that clauſe, as the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent referres unto God, <hi>I know thou wilt not hold me innocent.</hi>

                     <p>I ſhall note only this from it, <hi>He that judgeth of a mans innocency by his outward estate; may for ever condemn an innocent. Bildad</hi> judged ſo of <hi>Job,</hi> this cauſed <hi>Job</hi> to ſay, <hi>I know thou wilt not hold me innocent,</hi> or think me good, ſeeing evils are ſtill upon me, and are like to continue upon me ſtill. <hi>Iudge not according to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but judge righteous judgement,</hi> is the rule of Chriſt (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.24.) as if they could hardly judge what is right, who judge by what appears. We muſt not judge of things till they appear; nor may we judge of perſons by their appearance. As oftentimes in holineſſe, ſo ſometime in ſinfullneſſe, men are not what they ſeem to be.

It is eaſier to do good, then to be good; and uſually they who are good ſuffer that which is evil.</p>

If I waſh my ſelf with ſnow-water,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, Either I am wicked, or I am clean and pure; If I am wicked (as you ſay I am) I deſerve more puniſhment, then I labour in vain to be eaſed of this. If I am pure and clean, as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with ſnow-water, what will the iſſue be? God will yet caſt me into the ditch of affliction; ſo that I am between two wals hemmed in on both ſides: <hi>Wickedneſſe would certainly ruine me, and my righteouſneſſe will not deliver me, Why therefore doe ye feed me with vain hopes that I ſhould be delivered, if I were righteous!</hi> So <hi>Bildad</hi> aſſured him in the former Chapter.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, Some interpret his words as a conteſt with God; Thus; if by my ſtudy of holineſſe, and care to walk circumſpectly in thy waies, I have not yet gained the reputation of holineſſe; If I cannot yet paſſe in thy account for a godly man, ſurely I ſhall ſtill labour in vain about that point, as hitherto I have done.</p>
                     <p>But ſecondly (for I lay this aſide) Others thus, <hi>If I am wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> it is a vain thing for me to ſeek the Lord, as you adviſe me. Why will you put me upon a buſineſſe which will be fruitleſſe and without ſucceſſe? It was the word of God in <hi>Jobs</hi> time, though no Scripture,<note place="margin">Si autem &amp; ſic impius ſum fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra laboravi, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſi impius ſum, ut vos de me dicitis. <hi>Vul.</hi>

                        <hi>That God heareth not ſinners:</hi> Not ſuch ſinners as <hi>Jobs</hi> friends challenged him to be. So <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to compare their opinion of him, and counſell given him thus together; your opinion of me is, that I am a wicked man; your counſell to me is, that I ſhould ſeek unto God: Surely, your opinion of me, and your counſel to me can never agree, for if I am wicked (as you hold me to be) I labour in vain, while I obey your counſell.</p>
                     <p>There is a ſenſe, wherein it is in vain for a wicked man to ſeek unto God, and a ſenſe wherein it is not in vain for a wicked man to ſeek unto God: we muſt diſtinguiſh of this interpretation.</p>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:51057:184"/>
                     <p>If a man be wicked, it is in vain for him to ſeek unto God, while he loveth wickedneſſe and delighteth in it. Pſal. 66.2 <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my praier.</hi> He that is ſo wicked as to love wickedneſſe, praies in vain, faſts and humbles his ſoul in vain. <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord,</hi> that is, the Lord abominates his ſacrifice, but, <hi>The prayer of the upright is his delight. Solomon</hi> deſcribes an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite in the former words: he is one that will pray and offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and yet puts the <hi>ſtumbling block of his iniquity before his face</hi> (Ezek. 14.4.) So they (<hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4.) cried, <hi>The temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord are theſe;</hi> The Prophet diſcovers, who theſe <hi>zealous Templers</hi> were, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Will ye ſteal, murder, and commit adultery, and ſwear falſly, and then come and ſtand in this houſe, which is called by my Name, and ſay, We are delivered to doe all theſe abominations?</hi> Some mingle prayer and faſting with ſtealing and murdering: ſuch praying and faſting, are as unacceptable to God, as ſtealing and murdering are: Such labouring to pleaſe the Lord, is diſpleaſing to the Lord. <hi>What haſt thou to doe (ſaith God to the wicked) to take my Covenant into thy mouth</hi> (Pſal. 50.16.) Doth God ſay to the wicked, What haſt thou to doe with my Covenant? For whom is the Covenant made, but for the wicked? If men were not wicked or ſinfull, what needed there a Covenant of grace? The Covenant is for the wicked. And the Covenant brings grace enough to pardon thoſe who are moſt wicked; why then doth the Lord ſay to the wicked, <hi>What haſt thou to doe to take my Covenant into thy mouth?</hi> Obſerve what follows, and his meaning is expounded, <hi>Seeing thou hateſt to be reformed;</hi> As if God had ſaid, Thou wicked man, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecteſt thy ſinne, and holdeſt it cloſe, refuſing to return, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to reform; what haſt thou to doe to meddle with my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? <hi>Lay off thy defiled hands. He that is reſolved to hold his ſinne, takes hold of the Covenant in vain, or rather he lets it goe, while he ſeems to hold it.</hi> Woe unto thoſe who ſue for mercy, while they neglect duty. Thus a wicked man labours in vain.</p>
                     <p>But there is a ſenſe in which a wicked man doth not labour in vain, how wicked ſoever he is. What elſe means the Prophets invitation (Iſa. 55.5.) <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Let him forſake his waies, and then no matter what his
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:51057:185"/> waies have been, let him return to the Lord, and then his former departures ſhall not hinder acceptance. <hi>Chriſt died for the ungodly, Ro.</hi> 5.6. &amp; <hi>God juſtifieth the ungodly</hi> Ro. 4.5. It is not in vain for an ungodly man to come to God indeed, and when he doth, he ceaſes to be ungodly. They draw nigh only with their lips, whoſe hearts are not changed, and they draw nigh in vain. <hi>As God hath not ſaid to the ſeed of Iacob</hi> (reall Saints) <hi>Seek ye me in vain.</hi> So he hath not ſaid in vain to wicked men, Seek ye my face. For with the word which bids them ſeek, he gives them power to ſeek, and the mercy they ſeek for. The grace of God prevents us, that we may ſeek him, and bleſſes us when we doe ſeek him. If all who are wicked la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain, then all had laboured in vain, foraſmuch as all vvere wicked.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, You may take the meaning of it thus, <hi>If I am wicked;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Si adhuc mecu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agit Deus tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam cum im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pto, quo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Davids</hi> afflictions wrought as hard concluſions in him, as <hi>Iobs</hi> did, <hi>Grace acts and ſpeaks ever like it ſelf, but a gracious man doth not.

                     </p>
                     <p>I have no hope, ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> to get out of theſe afflictions, which fall upon wicked men, or to get one ſtep beyond a wicked man in your reputation, my labour is in vain, why then doe I labour? When the heart ſinks, the hands hang down. Where the one gives over believing, and hoping, the other give over acting and working. Hence the afflicted are called upon by the Apoſtle, <hi>to lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees</hi> (Heb. 12.12.) Hands and knees are the inſtruments of action and motion; and the hanging down of theſe imports both retarded or ſtopt; Thoſe afflicted Hebrews ſaw little or no hope of deliverance, therefore they gave over endeavouring and moving after deliverance.</p>

But doubtleſſe <hi>Job</hi> had reference to thoſe rites either of the Jews or Gentiles, when he ſaid,
<q>Though I waſh my ſelf with ſnow-water.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Why with ſnow-water?</hi> That is (ſay ſome) with the moſt pure water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the cleareſt ſpringing fountain water, or in the moſt cryſtall ſtreams, not in the water of melted ſnow, but in water like ſnow for purity and orient clearneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Others, Conceive it an alluſion to that peculiar rite in thoſe times, when they took ſnow-water to waſh with, rather then ſpring or river water, becauſe that came from the heavens, not from the earth here below; and was therefore (in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) more excellent in it's nature, becauſe it had a more excellent originall.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Job</hi> is thought to ſpecifie <hi>ſnow-water,</hi> becauſe in thoſe Countreys the fountain or river-water was not pure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:51057:186"/> they preſerved ſnow, and took that water to waſh and cleanſe with. As the cuſtom ſtill is in thoſe places where good wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is a rare commodity.</p>
                     <p>Or laſtly, He may ſay, <hi>If I waſh in ſnow-water,</hi> becauſe he would expreſſe the cleaneſt waſhing, ſuch as makes the body look like ſnow, white and pure. <hi>White as ſnow</hi> is a proverbiall (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18.) for the moſt reſplendent whiteneſſe.<note place="margin">In Scriptura talibus aliquis dicitur lotus, qualtum reſerre videtur ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem. <hi>Sanct.</hi>
                        </note> And we finde in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, a thing is ſaid to be waſhed vvith that, the likeneſſe of vvhich after waſhing it repreſents: Thus the Church glories in Chriſt, <hi>That his eyes were as the eyes of a Dove by the rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waſhed with milk</hi> (Cant. 5.12.) that is, his eyes were white as milk, after waſhing. So here, <hi>Though I waſh my ſelf with ſnow-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that is, though I waſh my ſelf, till I become as white and as pure as ſnow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We read a like phraſe (Pſal. 51.9.) <hi>Purge me with hyſop, and I ſhall be clean,</hi> in alluſion to the Leviticall law, which appointed the Prieſt to ſprinkle both things and perſons with a bunch of hyſop (<hi>Levit.</hi> 14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.) So the Chaldee paraphraſe expounds the Pſalm, <hi>Cleanſe me, as the Priest sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with hyſop cleanſed the people. Though I waſh my ſelf with ſnow-water,</hi>
                        <q>And make my hands never ſo clean.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Hebrew text is very emphaticall, <hi>Though I waſh mine hands in purity;</hi> which ſome expreſſe by that which is the inſtrument of purifying the hands, <hi>Though I waſh my hands with ſope;</hi> So M. <hi>Broughton,</hi> Though I waſh my hands with waſh-bals, to make my hands clean and ſweet. We tranſlate, though not to the letter of the Hebrew, yet to the ſenſe, <hi>Though I waſh my hands ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo clean, yet,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>As the former expreſſion referreth to internall holineſſe: ſo this later to externall. The hands in Scripture note our outward works. Hands are the executive part, the inſtruments of action <hi>Your hands are full of bloud,</hi> Iſa. 1. that is, your actions are cruell and bloudy: there is not only bloud in your hearts, but in your hands too (Pſal. 26.6.) <hi>I will waſh mine hands in innocency, ſo will I compaſſe thine altar,</hi> that is, I will make all my outward conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation pure and holy.

                     <p>Beſides, It was uſuall to waſh the hands, as an emblem or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of innocency, and freedom from guilt. The law of <hi>Moſes</hi> appointed, in caſe a man were ſlain, no man knowing how, that the Elders of the neereſt City, ſhould waſh their hands over the Heifer that was offered in Sacrifice, ſaying, <hi>Our hands have not ſhed this bloud, neither have our eyes ſeen it,</hi> Deut. 21.6, 7. So <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> when he would make it viſible unto all the world (as he thought) that he was free from the bloud of Chriſt, called for a baſin of water to waſh his hands: all the water in the Ocean could not waſh <hi>Pilates</hi> conſcience from the guilt of Chriſts bloud, yet he called for a baſin of water, and waſhed his hands, ſaying, <hi>I am free from the bloud of this juſt perſon,</hi>

Yea, our purgings and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are ſometimes ſo far from cauſing God to take off our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that they doe but fit us for more affliction: For the Lord will not truſt an impure ſpirit, or an heart defiled under many corruptions, under great afflictions. He therefore cleanſes many, and makes them more holy, that they may be more fit to bear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. No certain argument can be grounded upon this, that a man ſhall come out of affliction, becauſe he is cleanſed, for God chuſes (in ſome caſes) to afflict ſuch moſt,<note place="margin">☞</note> who are moſt cleanſed. The Lord hath as much ſervice from us, while we ſuffer, as while we doe his will; paſſive obedience is higher and harder ſervice then active, and an unclean heart is of the two (though it be fit for neither) more unfit for ſuffering then for doing. Therefore <hi>Jobs</hi> friends could not groundedly affirm, that he ſhould be delivered, if he were cleanſed. Indeed if Gods

                  </q>
                  <p>In which words <hi>Job</hi> offers two things to aſſure them that he was farre enough from ſuch an engaging with God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From the diſparity of their condition (verſ. 32.) <hi>He is not a man as I am.</hi> God is not like me, I am no match for God; and I will not be ſo fool-hardy, as to contend with one, who is infinitely above me.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Leſt any ſhould thinke, that though himſelf, hand to hand (as we ſpeak) would not venture upon God, yet he might (poſſibly) get ſome friend or ſecond, to interpoſe and umpire it between them, or to determine whether Gods dealings with him were juſt and equall, or no: And ſo (though not alone, yet) by a friend, or a third party to them both, he would try out the matter. No (ſaith <hi>Job</hi> in the 33. verſe) Not ſo neither, as I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:51057:190"/> will not undertake him; ſo <hi>neither is there any Daies-man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the two laſt verſes <hi>Job</hi> makes a petition to the Lord, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a favourable condeſcenſion, that he would be pleaſed to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the preſent height and extremity of his pain, and then he hoped yet, that he might anſwer him, though he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with him; anſwer him in reference to his own integrity, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which his friends had charged and wounded him, though not in reference to his own righteouſneſſe, about which the Lord might charge and condemn him, <hi>Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrifie me, then would I speak and not fear him, but it is not ſo with me.</hi> He concludes with the difference of his ſtate, from what he deſired of God it might be: And he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the difference of his perſon from what God himſelf is. It is not with me as I could wiſh, and God is not ſuch an one, nor can be, as I am, and muſt be.</p>

                     <p>He doth not ſay, God is not ſuch a man as I am, but God is not a man as I am. One man may ſay unto another man, Thou art not ſuch a man as I am: Every different degree or endowment among men, may bear a man out in ſaying ſo, and pride will prompt a man to ſay ſo, when he is not in degree better, but in kinde worſe then other men.

                     <p>The words import a double difference. Firſt, A difference in qualification.

                     <p>Secondly, As they contain a reaſon, why the Lord would judge him impure, though he ſhould waſh himſelf with ſnow-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo alſo, why the Lord would afflict him, though he ſhould waſh himſelf with ſnow-water, <hi>He is not a man as I am.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Should I ſee a man without ſpot or ſpeck, without blame or fault, yet full of wounds and ſtripes, full of troubles and ſorrows: Should I ſee him afflicted, of whom I could not ſay he had ſinned, it were beyond my reaſon. But though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, yet the Lord can ſee reaſon to afflict a man in whom I ſee no iniquity. He knows why and wherefore, he may and doth caſt them into the fire, in whom I can ſee no droſſe. <hi>He is not a man as I am.</hi> God exceeds man in his actings, as much as he doth in his nature, as he is what man is not, ſo he can doe what man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, <hi>Every thing is in working, as it is in being.</hi> God alwaies works like himſelf, and infinitely above man.</p>
                     <p>As to the preſent buſineſſe, he works above man chiefly in two things.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Man cannot juſtly commence a ſute againſt, or contend with another man, except he be able to charge him with ſome wrong that he hath done him, or lay ſome crime to his charge.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, A humane Judge cannot condemn or caſt a man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he firſt legally convict him of his crime.

If the Lord demand a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or an account of me, I could not ſatisfie him. Many, vvho can give a reaſon of the hope that is in them, cannot give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſufferings, which are upon them: But though they know no particular reaſon why they ſuffer, yet they believe it is not without reaſon. Some holy Martyrs have ſaid to their cruell perſecutours, urging them with ſophiſticall Queſtions, <hi>We can die, but we cannot dispute.</hi> And ſo the Saints, under the moſt difficult providences of God, are reſolved to ſay, We can die under them, but vve vvill not diſpute them. He is not a man that vve ſhould anſwer him in vvhat he ſpeaks or doth.</p>
                     <p>Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>The conſideration, that God is above man, is enough to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſilence man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>No man is proud in the preſence of another vvhom he thinks to be his better. The ſight of greater beauty, keeps down pride of beauty. <hi>Pride cannot live in the eye of that which is above the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it in our ſelves:</hi> Yea, he that findes he is but equall, or upon even ground vvith others, can hardly be proud of any thing in himſelf. While vve ſuppoſe our gifts or knowledge, but like thoſe of other men, vve are not lifted up in the opinion of them. Now, If equality check pride, a thought of ſuperiority muſt needs kill it. And if the common ſuperiority of a man kiſs our pride, how much more doth the knowledge of that ſuperexcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſuperiority vvhich is in God? Doth not the beauty and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:51057:191"/> of God, obſcure the luſtre and darken the beauty of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Is the ſhining of the ſtars any thing, vvhen the Sun appears? Much leſſe is the holines, ſtrength, and goodnes of man any thing, when the goodnes, holines and ſtrength of God ſtand forth or appear: we muſt ſay we are nothing, when we ſee what God is. The ſight of him, in vvhom nothing of our imperfections can be found, cannot but humble us in the ſight of all our perfections. Hence, vvhen the Lord vvould abaſe man, and extoll himſelf, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves all of man from himſelf (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.29.) <hi>God is not a man that he ſhould repen;</hi> Men are full of repentings, and that they are ſo, ſhews them to be men. There is a repentance vvhich is a grace of God, and there is a repentance vvhich is an infirmity in man. By the former, men turn to God from that ſin, in vvhich they vvere, or have done. By the later, men turn both from God and man in what they promiſe or purpoſe, either to be or doe. They are this day of one minde, and to morrow of another; to day they love, and to morrow they hate; now they vvill, and anon they vvill not. They are in and out, no man knows vvhere to finde them; but God is ever the ſame, he changes not. <hi>Elihu</hi> ſends a challenge to all teachers, in the name of God, <hi>Who teacheth like him?</hi> (Chap. 36.22.) God himſelf challengeth <hi>Job</hi> in his own name (Chap. 40.9.) <hi>Haſt thou an arm like God? Or canſt thou thunder with a voice like him? To whom will you liken me</hi> (ſaith God, vvhen he vvould bring down the pride of the creature) <hi>To whom will you liken me, and make me equall, and compare me, that we may be like?</hi> (Iſa. 46.5.) Why doe ye exalt your ſelves? Why have ye ſuch high thoughts of your ſelves? Can ye finde out any to compare with me? Or can ye make a parallel of me among all my creatures?</p>
                     <p>All the unevenneſſe of man towards God, ariſes from preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous thoughts of his evenneſſe with God. Take a taſte in two or three particulars.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Man grows into a boldneſſe of ſinning againſt God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thinks God is but ſo holy as man is; he conceits that which ſutes his ſpirit, ſutes Gods Spirit alſo: This cauſeth him to doe many things moſt unſutable to the Spirit of God (Pſal. 50.18.) <hi>When thou ſaweſt a thief, then thou conſenteſt with him, and thou haſt been partaker with the adulterer: thou giveſt thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>theſe things haſt thou done.</hi> And what encouraged or hardned him to doe theſe things? The
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:51057:192"/> next words give us an account of that, <hi>Thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch an one as thy ſelf;</hi> that is, thou didſt frame concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of me according to the <hi>Idaea</hi> of thine own brain, or the model of thine own heart. Thou waſt well pleaſed with ſuch filthines and abominations, therfore thou didſt conclude, I would not be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with them. The true reaſon why moſt men make nothing of evil, is, becauſe they make God nothing in goodnes (as to that point) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond themſelves; this doth not trouble our ſpirits, we ſee no hurt in what we do: Surely then God ſees no hurt in it, neither is his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit troubled with our doings.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Boldneſſe in pleading with, and complaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, when he doth what likes not us, ariſes from thoughts that we are like him. None would quarrell what God doth in cutting out and proportioning their own eſtates to them: or in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting down the humble and meek; in exalting the proud and vile, if they did fully believe God had as much right and reaſon as they ſee he hath power to doe what he doth. Man draws God into his own compaſſe, and then wonders to finde him work ſo out of compaſſe. If I were as God, ſaith one, I would doe thus and thus; ſurely, God is as I am, he hath ſuch thoughts as I have, ſaith another, then why doth he thus? Till we have fully ſtudied this point, <hi>That God is not as we are,</hi> we ſhall never reſt fully ſatisfied in what God doth, if he doth what we would not.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Unbelief ſprings from the ſame muddy fountain: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of the power of God to deliver us, when we are in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtraits and dangers; and unbelief of the mercy of God to pardon us, when we are in ſpirituall ſtraits and deſertions. What's the reaſon why, vvhen great dangers encompaſſe us, we cannot believe deliverance? Doe vve not make God like to our ſelves? Doe we not ſhorten his hand to our own meaſure, and thinke it cannot be done, becauſe men cannot doe it? And for mercy about the pardon of ſin; man being awakened ſees how he hath provoked God, ſin ſtares upon his face, and he findes out many aggravations upon his ſin: then he begins to collect thus, certainly if a man had ſo provoked his neighbour, he could never pardon or forgive him; Can then ſuch ſins as theſe be forgiven by God? Mans mercy cannot reach ſo high as this, therefore ſurely the mercies of God will not. We have a very gracious promiſe, backt with a caution to prevent theſe jealouſies (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6, 7.) <hi>Let the wicked for ſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:51057:192"/> and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Now, as when God cals upon man to obey his will, and doe his Commandments, he is apt to ſay, at leaſt in his heart, the duties are too many, and the burdens too great to be born: So when the Lord calleth upon wicked men, the worſt of wicked men to repent or turn unto him, and he vvill abundantly pardon, or he will multiply to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don (as it is in the originall) they are ready to object, What? Pardon ſuch as vve are? We are too filthy and vile for waſhing. Surely, he vvill not pardon us. Theſe mercies are too many for us, and theſe favours too great for us to receive. Well (ſaith God) I preconceive your conceits of me, ye are meaſuring me by your ſelves, ye think it cannot be done, becauſe ye cannot doe it; your hearts are too narrow to paſſe by ſo many, ſo great provocations, therefore ye ſay, mine is too narrow alſo. Doe ye thus meaſure me the Lord, O fooliſh people and unwiſe? I would have you know, <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are your waies my waies, for as the heavens are higher then the earth, ſo are my waies higher then your waies, and my thoughts then your thoughts,</hi> verſ 8, 9. As if he had ſaid, Your thoughts are as much below my mercy, as your waies were below my holineſſe. Ceaſe then from doubting vvhat I have promiſed, as I vvould have you ceaſe from doing vvhat I have forbidden, Your unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that I vvill not pardon your ſin, diſhonours me as much as your diſobedience did in committing ſinne. Till vve believe God is holy above us, vve fear not to ſinne; and till vve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God is mercifull above us, we cannot believe he will pardon our ſin.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee how the lifting up of our ſelves in our thoughts to an equality, or to ſome ſimilitude vvith God, or the drawing down of God to an equality, or ſome ſimilitude vvith our ſelves, is the ground and cauſe of all our unequall carriage towards God, of our boldneſſe in ſinning, of our boldneſſe in pleading with, and complaining againſt him, of our extreme unbelief in the point of deliverance from troubles, or of the pardon of our ſins. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>There is no compariſon between God and man.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>He is not a man as I am.</hi> Man is like to man, face anſwers face, and heart anſwers heart, ſtrength anſwers ſtrength, and vvit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers vvit. <hi>Solomon</hi> concludes this (Eccleſ. 6.10.) <hi>That which
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:51057:193"/> hath been, is named already, and it is known that it is man.</hi> A man it but a man, be he never ſo great in vvorldly vvealth or honour: as he bears the name, ſo he hath the nature of man ſtill; <hi>Nor can he contend with him that is mightier then he, i. e.</hi> vvith God. If he venture beyond his line, or move out of the ſphear of his activity, if he vvould act more then a man, he ſhall quickly finde that he is but man, <hi>He cannot contend with him that is mightier then he.</hi> Man vvas indeed made in the likeneſſe of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. <hi>In the image of God created he him,</hi> yet vve muſt not ſay, God is like man, he is not in our image. God put ſome impreſſions of himſelf upon man, but he took no impreſſions of man upon himſelf. <hi>He is not a man as I am.</hi> He hath given us ſome of his own excellencies, but he hath not taken upon him any of our vveakneſſes. God hath honoured man to give him ſomewhat of himſelf, but God ſhould diſhonour himſelf to take anything of man. Thus man is in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God: but God is not in the likeneſſe of man. Take heed of ſuch thoughts. <hi>It is as dangerous to frame a likeneſſe or a ſimilitude of God to our hearts, as to frame a likeneſſe or a ſimilitude of God upon a wall</hi> (Exod. 15.10.) <hi>Who is like unto thee, O Lord, amongst the gods?</hi> That is, there is none like unto thee: None amongſt the gods, neither among thoſe who are falſly called gods, the Idols of the Heathen, nor among thoſe who are truly called <hi>gods</hi> (for God cals them ſo) the Angels in heaven, and Magiſtrates here upon the earth: among theſe truly called gods, there is none like the true God, much leſſe is there any among the meer pure mortals, like unto the immortall God. <hi>Who is like unto thee, glorious in holineſſe, fearfull in praiſes, doing wonders?</hi> So (<hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18.) <hi>Who is a god like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by the tranſgreſſion of the remnant of his heritage. Who is a god like unto thee?</hi> Not only is there no man that can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don as God, but there is no God that can pardon like God, he puts it upon that, <hi>Who is a god like unto thee?</hi> Not as if he granted that there were any other gods beſides the Lord, but to meet with the thoughts of men, with thoſe ſinfull principles and conceits, which lodge in man, and make other gods. To ſay of God only this, <hi>He is God,</hi> is to ſay all; we cannot ſay more good of God, then to call him God; as we cannot ſay more evil of ſin, then to call it ſin; when we have called it ſin, vve have called it all. The Apoſtle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13.) puts that upon it, as the worſt he could ſay of it, <hi>Sinne that it might appear ſinne.</hi> We
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:51057:193"/> cannot repreſent it in a worſe likeneſſe then its own. All men ſay they ſin, but <hi>ſin appears ſin</hi> to very few. And when the Apoſtle would put a diſgracefull title or epethite upon ſin, he inveſts it with its own name, <hi>ſinfull ſin.</hi> Thus to the point in hand, we cannot call God more, then when we call him God. Nothing can be predicated of him better then himſelf. When God appears to be God, all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency appears. All men (almoſt) acknowledge God, but God appears to very few. 'Tis but little of God that can be known: and there are not many who know that little; very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny know but little of that little, and moſt know nothing of it at all.</p>
                     <p>Thus alſo to ſay that man is man, is proof and aggravation enough of his depraved condition (Hoſ. 6.7.) <hi>They like men have tranſgreſſed the Covenant,</hi> they have done like themſelves. When we ſee men vain, and wicked, and ſinfull, and covetous, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we may ſay of them, they have done like men; and how wonderous and glorious things ſoever God doth, we can but ſay, <hi>He hath done like God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As a conſectary from the whole, take this caution, <hi>If God is not a man as we are, then God muſt never be meaſured by the rule and line of man.</hi> Man hath not line enough to meaſure God by. The Lord exceeds man in all; he is not only above mans infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but he is above all his perfections. The Lord is not only not weak as man is weak, or unholy as man is unholy, but the Lord is not ſtrong as man is ſtrong, nor holy as man is holy, nor juſt as man is juſt, nor wiſe as man is wiſe: Then, man muſt not venture to judge of the wiſdome of God by his own wiſdome, or of the juſtice, holineſſe and ſtrength of God, by his own ſtrength, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and juſtice. Man is not able to meaſure God in any of his Attributes; and in three things eſpecially, man ſhould take heed of meaſuring God in his actings.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In the great work of election. In this man is very apt to be meddling, and to be meaſuring God by the line of naturall reaſon, or of civil juſtice: the Apoſtles diſpute beats down this preſumption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. We read there how man begins to buſtle and ſtartle at that great concluſion (verſ. 18.) <hi>Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.</hi> If it be thus, ſaith he, if every mans ſtate be peremptorily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the will of God, if he loves and hates before men have done either good or evil, <hi>Why doth he finde fault? for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> What need any trouble themſelves about the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:51057:194"/> way, when their end is under an unmovable decree? Why ſhould any ſtrive to forſake evil and doe good on earth, ſeeing it was reſolved in heaven what ſhould become of them, before they had done either good or evil? Thus the pride and ignorance of man cavils at the decrees of God. But ſtay (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>O man, who art thou that replieſt againſt God!</hi> He is not a man as thou art: he hath done what he hath done by vertue of his juſt prerogative, and therefore he is not unjuſt in doing it. Beſides, if ye will needs argue from reaſon, then ſee how common reaſon confutes this blaſphemy, <hi>Hath not the Potter power over the clay, of the ſame lump to make one veſſell unto honour, and another unto diſhonour?</hi> What if God hath done thus, and what if he will doe thus? What haſt thou to doe with it? Know thy place, and keep thy rank; art not thou clay in the hand of the Potter?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Meaſure not God by your own line in his providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall diſpenſations: He may have a method of his own in giving or taking away, in pulling down or building up, in wounding or healing, in abaſing man, or in raiſing him, becauſe all is his own. <hi>He who hath a right to all, can wrong none, and he who poſſeſſes all, is debtour to none.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Meaſure not God by your own line in the matter of your ordinary approvings: and that two waies.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Doe it not in your approving of things. And</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Doe it not in your approving of perſons. Take heed firſt of meaſuring God by your ſelves in your approving of things, as if becauſe you approve it, therefore God ſurely doth. This miſconceit hath been the cauſe of almoſt all, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the cauſe of all the ſuperſtition, idolatry and will-worſhip that ever was in the world. Man thinks God muſt needs like any thing which is done to his honour; hence becauſe the adorning and adoring of images, bowing to altars, uſing of unwritten Ceremonies are directed to the honour of God, therfore man concludes ſurely God likes them. Whereas nothing pleaſes God, but what himſelf appoints: he is never honoured, but when he is obeyed. As no man hath been his counſellour, to direct him what to doe with us: So no man can be his counſellour, to direct him what to require of us. <hi>Not that which we commend is approved, but that which the Lord commends.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Take heed of this in your approbation or eſtimation
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:51057:194"/> of perſons, <hi>Not be whom you commend is approved, but he whom the Lord commends.</hi> We ſhould judge of men as we believe God judges. Or (to come nearer) let no man think himſelf is approved of God, becauſe he is approved by himſelf. <hi>Many flatter themſelves in their own eyes, till their iniquity is found to be hatefull</hi> (Pſal. 36.2.) Chriſt intimates this, ſpeaking to the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees (<hi>Luk.</hi> 16.15.) <hi>Ye are they that juſtifie your ſelves,</hi> ye have high thoughts of your own worth, and glory in your own excellencies, and ye think God hath high thoughts of you, that he glories in you too; but let me tell you, <hi>That which is highly eſteemed amongſt men, is an abomination in the ſight of God.</hi> We are the men, ſaid the Phariſees, ours are excellent gifts, thus they admired and doted upon themſelves: but the Lord found them out, and what they highly eſteemed, he abominated. Some write and ſubſcribe their own letters teſtimoniall, and can get no hand to them but their own. <hi>Not he who commends himſelf is approved, but he whom the Lord commends;</hi> ſuch ſhall finde, that their own good word would do them no good, <hi>He is not a man as they are. He,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job, is not a man as I am, that I ſhould anſwer him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>And we ſhould come together in judgement.</q>
                     <p>It hath been ſhewed what <hi>judgement</hi> is, at the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of this Chapter, and at the third verſe of the eighth Chapter, therefore I ſhall not now ſtay upon it, only as to the matter in hand; Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be taken three waies.</p>

                     <p>Here <hi>Job</hi> chiefly intends the firſt, <hi>He is not a man as I am, that I ſhould anſwer him, and we ſhould come together in judgement,</hi> that is, that I ſhould plead, argue and debate my matters with him before any other Judge. God and man cannot come together to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for all man-kinde muſt receive their judgement from God.<note place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t veniamus pariter in judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium.</note> Or nearer the Hebrew (which ſutes the former clauſe better) <hi>He is not a man as I am, that we ſhould come alike to judgement;</hi> No, we ſhould be very unlike, very unequally matched in judgement. Man and man, who are upon even terms in their nature, may yet
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:51057:195"/> be upon ſuch uneven terms in their condition, that they cannot come alike to judgement. A poor man cannot grapple with a rich man, nor a mean man with the honourable. Now, if they who are of the ſame nature cannot come alike in judgment, becauſe of a diſparity in their condition; How ſhall they who differ not only in condition, but in nature? Can God and man? Can poor wretched and miſerable man, come alike in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the great and glorious God? And ſo the meaning of <hi>Job</hi> may be thus conceived, <hi>If I had only a man (like my ſelf) to deal with, then I would venture a triall with him, at any ſeat of judgement, or Court of Juſtice; but he is not a man as I am, much leſſe ſuch a man as I am. How ſhall I ſet my ſelf with him to be judged, when as himſelf is the Judge of all, and is himſelf judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of none?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Man is not able to contend with God in judgement.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Who is like me, and who will appoint me the time</hi> (or (nearer the letter) <hi>who will convent me in judgement?) Who is that ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd that will ſtand before me?</hi> Iſa. 49.19. Man muſt come before God in judgement, <hi>We muſt all appear before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt</hi> (2 Cor. 5.10.) None ſhall eſcape his tribunall. But man cannot ſtand before God in judgement. The wicked cannot ſtand at all before him in judgement, becauſe they ſtand upon their own bottom. The righteous dare not ſtand before him in judgement upon their own bottom; if they ſhould, themſelves and their cauſe would quickly fall together.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeven conſiderations which tell us, that we cannot come together, much leſſe alike together with God in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. He is of ſuch wiſdom, that none can over-reach him, nor can our wit entangle him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He is <hi>ſo knowing</hi> that none of our ſins and failings, no not the leaſt of them, are ſecrets to, or hidden from him.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He is ſo holy, that he cannot bear with the leaſt ſin, and ſo juſt, that he cannot but puniſh it, unleſſe he receive ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it.</p>

                        <pb n="385" facs="tcp:51057:195"/>6. He cannot be a party in judgement, for he is the ſupreme Judge, and there is no appealing from his ſentence.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. He is the laſt, yea an everlaſting Judge, and therefore there is no repealing of his ſentence. Who is able to contend with him, whom no power can daunt, no bribes corrupt, no wit over-reach, who knows all our ſins, and will ſpare none of them, from whoſe ſentence there is no appealing, and whoſe ſentence cannot be repealed? There is no Judge above God, therefore we cannot appeal from him; there is none to come after God, therefore what he hath judged cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> having thus waved and profeſſed againſt contending with God in judgement, proceedeth in the thirty third verſe, to ſhew that there is none to whom his caſe might be referred for arbitration. There are two waies by which controverſies are ended.</p>

                     <p>To lay on hands is diverſly uſed in Scripture. The hand ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies all power: Hence, to lay the hands, is to put forth pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and to do ſo, is taken ſome times in an ill ſenſe, and ſometimes in a good ſenſe.</p>
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:51057:197"/>
                     <p>Firſt, In an ill ſenſe, and ſo to lay the hands, is to ſtrike or ſmite even to death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.12. <hi>Lay not thine hand upon the childe, upon Iſaac,</hi> that is, do not ſlay him. We have the ſame expreſſion (<hi>Gen.</hi> 37.22.) when <hi>Reuben</hi> pleaded for <hi>Joſeph</hi> that he ſhould not be murthered, <hi>Shed no bloud, but caſt him into this pit, and lay no hand upon him;</hi> that is, do not deſtroy him. This laying on of the hands, notes any violent act, either proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from holy zeal or juſtice, as in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who threatens the prophaners of the Sabbath, <hi>If ye doe ſo again I will lay hands on you;</hi> or from malice, as in the chief Prieſts, <hi>who ſought to lay hands on Chriſt the Lord of the Sabbath</hi> (Luk. 20.19.) And Chriſt prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying what the condition of his Diſciples and of believers ſhould be, what uſage they ſhould finde in the world, tels them (<hi>Mat.</hi> 21.12.) <hi>They ſhall lay their hands upon you, and perſecute you.</hi> Thus <hi>Haman thought ſcorn to lay his hands on Mordecai alone</hi> (Eſth. 3.6.) He had a deſign to take revenge upon the whole Nation of the Jews.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To lay on the hands is taken in a good ſenſe; and ſo I finde it uſed three waies.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In benedictions, Mark 10.16. <hi>Chriſt took up the young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in his arms, and laid his hands upon them and bleſſed them.</hi> As under the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.4. and Chap. 4.15. The people or the Elders laying their hands upon the beaſt, which was to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in Sacrifice, intimated the laying of all their ſins by faith upon Chriſt, of whom that Sacrifice was a type. So Chriſts lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hands upon thoſe children, implied the beſtowing and pouring out of mercy upon them, in the pardoning of their ſins, and the furniſhing of them with the graces of his Spirit. The ſame action uſed by the Apoſtles in the name of Chriſt, had the ſame ſignification and effect. When <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> came to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> and ſaw what work the Word had made among that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>They laid their hands on them, and they received the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Act. 8.17. <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe laid his hands on the Diſciples at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and they received the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.6. It was uſed alſo as a ſign of healing, Mark 16.18. <hi>They ſhall lay hands on the ſick, and they ſhall recover:</hi> And (<hi>Mat.</hi> 9.18.) the Ruler ſaith unto Chriſt, <hi>My daughter is ſick, but come and lay thine hands on her, and ſhe ſhall be healed.</hi> Some interpret the Rulers deſire of this ſign, to be as a ſign he had faith, ſo alſo that his faith was weak. The Centurion (concerning whom Chriſt teſtified, <hi>I have not
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:51057:197"/> found ſo great faith, no not in Iſrael) deſired Chriſt but to speak the word only, and his ſervant ſhould be healed</hi> (Mat. 8.8.) As a word is the proper object of faith, ſo faith acts moſt properly, when it reſts and lives upon a <hi>word only.</hi> Signs are mercies to the weak, and they are witneſſes of our weakneſſe. <hi>Signs are but crouches and spectacles to help the lameneſſe and dimſightedneſſe of faith.</hi> But to our text.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Laying on of hands was uſed in the ordination or ſolemn ſetting of a man apart unto an office, <hi>The children of Iſrael,</hi> that is, ſome of the chief of them (under the Ceremoniall Law) <hi>laid their hands upon the Levites,</hi> Numb. 8.10.) which was either a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification that they gave up all carnall and worldly intereſts in them, and bequeathed them wholly unto God, or an approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their office, and of the Levites miniſtration in it on their behalf. The ſame Ceremony (for the matter) was continued in the ſending forth of Goſpel-officers. <hi>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecie, with the laying on of the hands of the Preſbytery,</hi> was <hi>Pauls</hi> counſell to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to himſelf (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.) And in reference to others (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22.) <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> being immediately deſigned by God for a ſpeciall work of the Miniſtery, to which they were called before,<note place="margin">Impoſitio ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Daies-man</hi> giving ſentence, laid his hand upon the head of him whom he found faulty, and to have done the wrong, in token of condemnation. Among the Ceremonies of conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Leviticall Prieſts, this is given in command (Exod. 29.10.) <hi>Thou ſhalt cauſe a bullock to be brought before the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and Aaron and his ſons ſhall put their hands upon the head of the bullock:</hi> And in the rules given concerning the burnt offerings of the people, it is directed, that the <hi>bringer ſhall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Levit.</hi> 1.4.) Now this laying of their hands upon the head of the Sacrifice, implied the laying of their ſins upon the head of the Sacrifice, and that, the laying of their ſins upon the head of Chriſt, on whom the Prophet aſſures us, <hi>The Lord laid the iniquity of us all</hi> (Iſa. 53.6.) And as the laying on of the hand upon the head of the beaſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd their ſins upon him, ſo likewiſe that ſentence of death and condemnation which was due to their ſin, and was preſently executed by ſlaying of the beaſt: which was a lively type of Chriſt (the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world) dying under a ſentence of condemnation in the ſtead of ſinners.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The laying on of the hand, notes the keeping of the parties in compaſſe, for contenders uſe to be very violent one againſt another.</p>

God hath referred the differences betwixt himſelf and man, unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and (his own good will and free grace moving him thereunto) he ſtands engaged in the bonds of his everlaſting truth and faithfulnes to perform what <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> as Mediatour, ſhould ask for us: unto him we may ſafely commit our cauſe and our ſouls, with that aſſurance of the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:51057:199"/> Apoſtle (2 Tim. 1.12.) <hi>I know whom I have believed, and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him againſt that day.</hi> Chriſt, God-man is umpire between God and man; what we truſt him with ſhall not miſcarry: he will make our cauſe good, and our perſons acceptable before God at that great day. It is infinite mercy, when we were neither able to mannage our own cauſe, nor to finde out any in heaven or earth who could, that then God himſelf ſhould finde out one, in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power like himſelf, one who <hi>thought it no robbery to be equall with God</hi> to be our <hi>Daies-man.</hi> Many of the Ancients in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this Text, either as <hi>Jobs</hi> deſire and praier, that Chriſt would come in the fleſh, <hi>O that there were a days-man betwixt us:</hi> or as a prophecy of Jeſus Chriſt, to come as our <hi>Daies-man</hi> in the fleſh, <hi>There is no Daies-man yet, but a Daies-man ſhall come.</hi> The ſenſe is pious, but the context will not bear it; In the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, v. 21. and Chap. 17. v. 3. We ſhall finde <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking clearly of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour Jeſus Chriſt, and of his great work of atonement between God and man. But here he ſeems to keep to the preſent contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, about the buſineſſe of affliction, not of ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Take two or three conſectaries flowing from the whole matter.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Job</hi> at the loweſt ſpeaks highly of God, and humbly of himſelf. <hi>The greater his afflictions were the purer was his language.</hi> He was not able to grapple with God, and there was none to be found who could umpire the matter betwixt them. <hi>The will of God is the ſupreme law.</hi> What he will do with us, we muſt be content he ſhould. The ſecrets of his providence are beyond our ſearch, and his judgements above our reach.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The greatneſſe and tranſcendency of God ſhould keep us low in our own thoughts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our knowledge of God is the preſent cure of our own pride. The knowledge of God cauſeth us to know our ſelves, and that which makes us know our ſelves, cannot but make us low in our ſelves. Though a proud man is commonly ſaid, <hi>To know himſelf too much,</hi> yet the truth is, he doth not know himſelf enough, no, nor at all, as he ſhould know himſelf. <hi>Many are proud of, and with their knowledge, yet pride is the daughter of ignorance.</hi> Some pride lodges in every mans heart, becauſe more then ſome igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doth. <hi>Job</hi> had ſome of both, in his; why doth he lay the thought of the infinite glory and ſoveraignty of God ſo often to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:51057:200"/> his heart, but to keep down or to cure the ſwellings of his heart.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He is not a man as we are</hi> (we are not able to match him) and <hi>there is</hi> (among men) <hi>no Daies-man betwixt us. David</hi> made it his election (2 Sam. 24.) <hi>To fall into the hands of God, and not into the hands of man.</hi> And it is beſt for us to fall into the hands of God (as <hi>David</hi> put himſelf into his hands) with reſpect to his great mercies.

He, I ſay, perceiving what it was which <hi>Job</hi> had complained of as an impediment of ſpeaking unto God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that himfelf would give him no ſuch impediment or cauſe of complaint (Chap. 33.7.) <hi>Behold, my terrour ſhall not make thee afraid, neither ſhall my hand be heavy upon thee;</hi> As if he had ſaid, The Lords hand hath been heavy upon thee, and his
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:51057:202"/> terrour hath made thee afraid, but (take my word) I will deal gently: and mildly with thee, <hi>My terrour ſhall not make thee afraid, neither ſhall my hand be heavy upon thee.</hi> So that, <hi>Jobs</hi> deſire is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, That he might have eaſe or releaſe from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>is preſent ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. And 'tis (not improbably) conceived, that he alludes to the cuſtom of the Judges in thoſe Eaſtern Countries, who laid a rod up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome offenders in token of condemation, and took it off from others in token of abſolution, of grace and favour. <hi>Take thy rod a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Affliction is called a rod in a three-fold conſideration.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Becauſe of the ſmart of it. <hi>Afflictions are grievous and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to fleſh and bloud.</hi> They grieve and pain the outward man, while the inward man takes pleaſure in them. <hi>I</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) take pleaſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in perſecutions, in neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake</hi> (2 Cor. 12.10.) that is, my ſpirit doth, for no affliction (not that for Chriſts ſake) is joyous for the preſent, but grievous to the fleſh. For, as the Spirit would not doe thoſe evils of ſin, which the fleſh would and doth (<hi>The evil which I would not that I doe,</hi> was <hi>Pauls</hi> cry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.19.) So the fleſh would not endure thoſe evils of ſorrow, which the Spirit would and doth. And as a believer delights in the Law of God, after the inward man, when corruption is vext and troubled at it; ſo a believer delights in the rod of God, after the inward man, when corruption is moſt impatient and unquiet under it. Hence the Apoſtles counſell to the diſperſed Jews, <hi>Rejoyce when ye fall into divers temptations</hi> (Jam. 1.) that is, into divers affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; the fleſh hath it's ſenſe, and feels ſmart; but the Spirit is armed with faith, which overcomes the ſmart. Affliction were not ſo much as a rod, if it did not make us ſmart; and we are not ſo much as Chriſtians, if we cannot bear the ſmart with patience, or overcome it with faith.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Affliction is called a Rod, in regard of the hand that uſeth it. A ſword is in the hand of a Judge, and a Rod in the hand of a father. God deals with his people as a father with his children in afflicting them. When we moſt provoke his fatherly diſpleaſure againſt us, he doth not wiſh (as <hi>Balaam</hi> when his Aſſe offended him) that there were a ſword in his hand to ſlay us; he only takes up a rod to ſcourge us. Hence</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Affliction is called a rod, in regard of the end for which it is ſent. A rod is not prepared to kill, nor is it an inſtrument of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:51057:202"/> cruelty. A rod is not for deſtruction, but for correction. There are indeed deſtroying rods, which God will deſtroy, and ſave his people who are deſtroied by them, <hi>I will deſtroy the rod of the oppreſſour</hi> (Iſa. 9.4.) <hi>Nebuchadnezzar the rod of Gods anger;</hi> was a deſtroying rod, yet they among the Jews, who feared God, were only corrected, while they were deſtroied. <hi>The Lord means no hurt to thoſe who are good, when he makes them ſmart and die under the rod of thoſe who are evil.</hi> If ever any man might think he had a ſword in his bowels, rather then a rod upon his back, <hi>Job</hi> might, yet even he cals it a rod, while he cals to God for the removing of it, <hi>Remove thy rod away from me.</hi> And ſeeing he cals to have it removed, we may obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That it is lawfull for to pray againſt affliction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may pray to be eaſed of that, which we muſt be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent under. To be diſcontented with affliction is ſinfull, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> it is no ſinne (it is a duty) to deſire the taking of it away. For</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We may pray for the preventing of afflictions, therefore we may pray for the removing of afflictions, we may pray, <hi>Lord, keep thy rod off from us;</hi> therefore we may pray, <hi>Lord, take thy rod off from us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Afflictions themſelves are evil. There is no good in them, nor can they doe us any good of themſelves. The good commeth from a ſuperiour work, from thoſe admirable influences and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of God upon, and with corrections. The rod is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in it ſelf, and will make us worſe, unleſſe the Lord make it a bleſſing to us. Some are ſtubborn under the rod: and their hearts are hardened, while themſelves are melted in the fire of affliction. As man lives not by bread alone: So man mends not by the rod alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. Tis little leſſe then a miracle that this dry rod (as that of <hi>Aaron</hi> did naturall) ſhould bloſſom and bring forth ſpirituall fruit, the fruits of righteouſneſſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. We may pray for the removing of afflictions, becauſe the Lord often ſends afflictions upon this meſſage, to beſpeak praier. Many a ſoul is ſluggiſh in prayer till awakened by the voice of the rod. When the rod makes the fleſh ſmart, then the Spirit (in whom any thing of the Spirit is) cries mightily unto God, and among the many things about which the ſoul exerciſes prayer under afflictions, this is one, that the affliction may be removed. As they alwaies ſin, who murmur at and quarrell with God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:51057:203"/> he corrects them, ſo alſo doe they, who ſay, they care not how long he corrects them, or let him correct them, as long as he will. It is as ill a ſign when a childe will not pray his parent to ſpare him, when he is about to chaſten him, or to ſtay his hand when he is chaſtening of him, as it is to reſiſt his chaſtiſement. <hi>There may be greater contempt of God in lying under affliction, then in reſiſting it.</hi> Now, as it is our duty to pray for deliverance out of trouble; ſo it is one end why the Lord caſts us into trouble, that we may be engaged to pray for deliverance.</p>
                     <p>But take it with a caution, we muſt not pray abſolutely for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, or the removall of afflictions, but at leaſt with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit limitation. While we are ſtriving earneſtly for the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the rod, we ſhould be ready to ſubmit, if the Lord will not take it away. A believer may ſay to the Lord (as wreſtling <hi>Jacob) I will not let thee goe except thou bleſſe me;</hi> but he muſt not ſay, I will not let thee goe, <hi>except thou now deliver me.</hi> Time, and means and manner muſt all be laid at Gods feet, and ſubmitted to his wiſdome. And we muſt honour God, though he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the rod, even while we are praying that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it.</p>
                     <p>For the cloſe of this point conſider, the rod may be removed, not only by a totall releaſe from affliction; But</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By an abatement of the affliction; as we are ſaid to leave off thoſe graces, from the degrees and lively actings of which we fall and decline: <hi>He that lacketh theſe things</hi> (that is, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth not, as he hath heretofore, in the exerciſe of them) <hi>is blinde,</hi> &amp;c. (2 Pet. 1.9.) <hi>Thou haſt left thy firſt love,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to the Angel of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when the heat of his former love was cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: So the Lord may be ſaid to remove our troubles, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the extremity, and cools the heat of them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The rod is removed, when it is ſanctified to us, when the Lord (who is excellent in working) cauſeth it to doe us good. The Saints die, yet <hi>death is aboliſhed,</hi> as to the Saints, by the death of Chriſt (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.) becauſe Chriſt hath pluckt out the ſting of their death, and made it a gain to them. Thus while Chriſt makes temporall loſſes or ſufferings an advantage to the ſpirituall eſtate of his people, he takes them away. And as outward bleſſings are taken away, from wicked men, while they poſſeſſe them, riches are not riches to them, nor is their honour an honour to them, becauſe they are enſnared by them: So the outward croſſe
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:51057:203"/> is taken away from the godly, while they ſuffer, becauſe they are bettered by the croſſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Affliction is removed from us, when Chriſt gives us ſtrength to bear affliction. Nothing grieves us, either in active or paſſive obedience, but what is either againſt our wils, or above our power; It is all one to have a burthen taken off our ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or to have ſo much ſtrength given, as makes it eaſie to us. While the Saints have trouble upon their backs and loins, they have no trouble in their hearts and ſpirits, when their ſpirits are carried above thoſe troubles. <hi>To conquer an enemy is more noble then to have none.</hi> Much more (which is promiſed the Saints in the throng of ſoreſt enemies) to be more then conquerours. In all, or any of theſe waies <hi>Jobs</hi> praier may be fulfilled, <hi>Take away thy rod from me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>And let not thy fear terrifie me.</q>
                     <p>There was ſomewhat more upon <hi>Job</hi> then a rod,<note place="margin">

                     <p>The word which we tranſlate <hi>[fear]</hi> comes from a root ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying that which is very formidable and terrible. <hi>Fear and dread ſhall fall upon them</hi> (Exod. 15.16.) that is, they ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely afraid, even dead with fear, as the next words import, <hi>They ſhall be ſtill as a ſtone,</hi> &amp;c.

There is alſo an amazing, and a terrifying fear, ſuch the letter of the originall imports this to be, even a fear bordering upon mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as if he were rather frighted then afraid, and ſcared, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then troubled.</p>
                     <p>Others expound this fear with reference to the two former verſes, eſpecially to the verſe immediately fore-going. There <hi>Job</hi> deſires a <hi>Daies-man,</hi> or complains that there is none; here he tels us what he might have expected, if he had one. As if he had ſaid, <hi>Had I a Daies-man, then I know he would take away the rod from me, that is, he would give judgement that I ſhould be eaſed of this affliction; and his fear ſhould not terrifie me, that is, he would never give a ſentence which ſhould be a terrour to me.</hi> That's a fair ſenſe in reference to what he ſpake before; but I rather keep his meaning within the compaſſe of what he is ſpeaking here.</p>

We finde when in thoſe ancient times God appeared, the beholders were terrified. <hi>Manoahs</hi> wife tels her husband, <hi>A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an Angel of God, very terrible</hi> (Judg. 13.6.) And when God appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Abraham, An horrour of great darkneſſe fell upon him</hi> (Gen. 15.12.) in what a wofull plight was <hi>Daniel,</hi> receiving the viſions of God? (<hi>Dan.</hi> 10.8.) God who is the joy of his people, is alſo a terrour to them. Things which are not what they ſeem to be, are not ſo terrible near hand as at a diſtance; God who is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more then he can ſeem to be, is more terrible near hand then at a diſtance. Hence it is, that when God, who is alwaies near us, ſhews himſelf to be ſo, our ſpirits fail within us. In that preſence of God which we ſhall have in glory, there will be fulneſſe of joy. And in that preſence of God which we have in the waies of grace, there is abundance of joy. But if while we are here in a
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:51057:204"/> ſtate of grace, ſome little of that preſence of God, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the ſtate of glory fals upon us, we are more diſtreſſed then comforted with it: How much more then, when God clothes himſelf with terrour, and (as he did to <hi>Job</hi>) ſo reveals himſelf unto us.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We may interpret <hi>this fear</hi> (by the former part of the verſe) the <hi>rod;</hi> his afflictions were terrible, the hand of God lifted up to ſmite him, made him afraid. But whether it were this or that, the majeſty of God overawing him, or the rod of God chaſtening him, the ſenſe is plain, <hi>Job</hi> was oppreſt with fear from the Lord, yea with terrour from the Almighty, cauſing this vehement deprecation, <hi>Let not his fear terrifie me.</hi> Hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That, <hi>God ſometimes appears terribly to thoſe he loves entirely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> was one of Gods darlings; and God was imbracing him, while he was ſcourging him. <hi>Job</hi> had kiſſes from heaven, when he felt nothing but laſhes here upon the earth. The heart of God was full of love, while his hand was filled with a rod; his bowels yearn'd upon <hi>Job,</hi> and his face terrified him at the ſame time. That precious man <hi>Heman,</hi> was followed with terrours and viſions of amazement all his daies, <hi>I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up, while I ſuffer thy terrours I am diſtracted (Pſal.</hi> 88.15.) The terrours of God, even terrours to diſtraction, may be the preſent portion of thoſe, whoſe portion is everlaſting mercy. Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Man is not able to bear the anger of G d.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though he be but correcting us, yet we cannot bear his anger toward us. This cauſed the Prophet to cry out (<hi>Jer.</hi> 10.24.) <hi>Correct me, O Lord, but not in thine anger.</hi> The words are not a praier for correction (I know no warrant for that) but a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to it. As if he had ſaid, Lord, I am willing to bear thy correction, but I cannot (and who can?) bear thine anger. The Church complains (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.7.) <hi>We are conſumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath we are troubled.</hi> The fatherly anger of God, is as a conſuming fire, and we are but as ſtubble before it: What then is the fierceneſſe of that anger, which he will pour out upon wicked men for ever! <hi>Who knoweth the power of thine anger? (Pſal.</hi> 90.11.) Man cannot underſtand how powerfull the anger of God is, much leſſe ſtand before the power of his anger. As
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:51057:205"/> man cannot comprehend the love of God (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.18, 19.) The Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>To know the love of God which paſſeth knowledge;</hi> that is, to know ſo much of it as is knowable; (the love of God is paſt the knowledge, not only of nature, but of grace, becauſe it is infinite) So we ſhould labour, <hi>To know the anger of God, which paſſeth knowledge,</hi> that is, to know it ſo farre as it is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The anger of God cannot be fully known, becauſe it hath an infiniteneſſe in it, as well as his love. And as the one ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be fully known, but by enjoying it; ſo neither can the other, but by feeling it. Upon this conſideration the Lord makes that gracious promiſe to his people (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.16.) <hi>I will not contend for ever, neither will I be alwaies wroth, for the ſpirit ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls which I have made.</hi> But is not the ſpirit or ſoul of man of an everlaſting make? And ſhall not the damned en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the contendings of Gods wrath for ever, and not fail? The ſubſtance of the ſoul cannot fail, and the ſpirit is incorruptible; The ſpirit is full of morall corruption, but it is not ſubject to natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall corruption, or the corruption of its nature. How glad would the damned be, if their ſpirits might fail, and their ſouls return to nothing. The failing of the ſpirit under the wrath of God, is the failing of its hope and courage. Thus the ſpirit ſinks, and the immortall ſoul dies away under the ſenſe and weight of Gods diſpleaſure.</p>

                           </gap>. Sept.</note>But is this the uſe which <hi>Iob</hi> would make of the mercy he begs? Doth he entreat the Lord to take his terrifying fear away from him, and then reſolve not to fear him at all? Whoſe voice is this? Is this the voice of <hi>Job, I will speak and not fear him? Jobs</hi> chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter in the firſt Chapter was, <hi>A man fearing God;</hi> and dares he now ſay, <hi>I will ſpeak and not fear him?</hi> As the fear of God ought to be the ſeaſoning of all our works and actions, ſo it ought to be the ſeaſoning of all our words and ſpeeches: why then doth he ſay, <hi>I will ſpeak and not fear him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To clear this, I anſwer, Fear may be taken two waies. Either for the grace of fear, or for the perturbation of fear. When <hi>Job</hi>
                        <pb n="405" facs="tcp:51057:205"/> ſaith, <hi>I would speak and not fear him,</hi> his meaning is not to lay down that fear of God, which is a bridle to the ſoul, keeping it from ſin, or that reverentiall affection, which fits us for, and ſhould act us in every holy duty we perform to God. When <hi>Job</hi> praied to be free from the fear of God, he reſolved thus to fear God. Tis only the perturbation of fear, diſtracting fear, not ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, humbling fear, which <hi>Job</hi> would lay aſide, when God ſhould pleaſe to with-draw his terrifying fear. And ſo his minde is plainly this. <hi>If the Lord will be entreated to remit the extremity of my affliction, and remove thoſe terrours wherewith I am affrighted, then I would ſpeak boldly and chearfully to him, I would ſet out the truth of my caſe, and declare the innocency of my perſon.</hi>

                     <p>While ſenſe is much troubled, reaſon cannot act much. <hi>When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himſelf in Iſrael</hi> (Hoſ. 13.1.) There, to ſpeak trembling, is, to ſpeak humbly. Our words to God ſhould be accompanied with low thoughts of our ſelves. <hi>Ephraims</hi> trembling is oppoſed to pride and hardneſſe of heart. They who thus tremble at the Word of God, are fitteſt to ſpeak to God; yet exceſſive trembling hinders us in ſpeaking. And untill the Lord quiets and compoſes our hearts by a word from heaven; till he ſpeak to our diſtempered mindes, as once to the raging ſea, Be quiet and ſtill; we cannot utter our hearts, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our mindes unto him. When God ſends a gracious meſſage to poor ſinners, and invites them to a conference, as he did his ancient people (Iſa. 1.18.) <hi>Come, let us reaſon together;</hi> then they come boldly to the throne of grace, notwithſtanding their crimſon and ſcarlet ſins. Then they are not afraid to ſpeak, they may ſpeak and not fear him.<note place="margin">

                     <p>There is much diverſity of opinion about theſe words.

                     <p>Firſt, Unto things, Jer. 8.6. <hi>The Lord hearkned and heard, and there was no man that spake (Chen)</hi> aright; or things which were right, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.10.

                        </note>Secondly, The word <hi>[Chen]</hi> is applied unto perſons, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a man that is upright hearted, faithfull and honeſt, both in conſcience and converſation. When <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren (<hi>Gen.</hi> 42.11, 19, 31.) pleaded for themſelves, they ſay unto him, We are <hi>(Chenim) right men, we are no ſpies.</hi> We are not come to finde out the weakneſſe of the Land, but to get a ſupply of our own wants. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſaid, <hi>Ye are ſpies,</hi> ye come to circumvent us, to put tricks upon us, to work your own ends, by diſcovering what we are; No, ſay they, pray, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, do not miſunderſtand us, we are <hi>(Chenim)</hi> honeſt, right-hearted, plain-meaning men.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The word is uſed adverbially, <hi>It is not ſo with me,</hi> that is, It is not ſo as you imagine. In which ſenſe we finde it, Gen. 1.7. <hi>The Lord ſaid, Let there be light, and it was</hi> (Chen) <hi>ſo,</hi> as the Lord commanded, ſo it was, Eccleſ. 8.10. <hi>I ſaw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were ſtrangers in the City, where they had done ſo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon both theſe ſignifications of the word, different interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ations of the whole are grounded.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Taking the word to note an upright hearted man, <hi>Iob</hi> is conceived to ſpeak interrogatively, as if he put this Queſtion, <hi>For am I not right in my ſelf?</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>If you thinke it too much boldneſſe that I have ſaid I would ſpeak unto God, and not fear him, Am not I right in my ſelf? Am not I found and true at heart?</hi> Thus he ſeems to allude unto that teſtimony, which God gave of him at the firſt verſe of this book, A man perfect and upright; As if he had ſaid, <hi>I am no turn-coat or apoſtate, I am as I was,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:51057:206"/> and I doubt not but I ſhall be what I am; ſtill perfect before God, and upright with men. And if ſo, why may not I have boldneſſe to come unto God, and ſpeak freely with him? They who are ſincere with God, may have great boldneſſe in comming unto God.</hi> Uprightneſſe hath boldneſſe with men; and uprightneſſe hath boldneſſe towards God. Though no uprightneſſe or righteouſneſſe in man can give him boldneſſe in himſelf, yet it may give him boldneſſe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. He may be aſſured, that though he cannot be <hi>acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted for his uprightneſſe, yet being upright he ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Others read it negatively,<hi>I would ſpeak, and not fear him, for I am not right in, or with my ſelf.</hi> And ſo the ſenſe may be made out thus, <hi>I have not gone about to juſtifie my ſelf all this while, I have not ſtood upon my own righteouſneſſe pleading with God; if my righteouſneſſe were in my ſelf, then I might fear to speak with God, though his fear ſhould not terrifie me, and though he ſhould take away his rod from me; but I have a better bottom then my own, I am not right in my ſelf, I am right only in the free grace of God, and in the righteouſnes of my redeemer.</hi> According to this expoſition he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his firſt propoſition, laid down in the ſecond verſe of this Chapter, <hi>How ſhould man be juſt or righteous with God? I am not right in my ſelf;</hi> as I ſaid in the beginning of my anſwer, <hi>Man is not righteous;</hi> ſo I now conclude in my own particular caſe, <hi>I am not righteous in my ſelf:</hi> and being righteous in another, if God would but give me a little reſpit from theſe ſorrows, I would ſpeak and not be afraid. This teaches us,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That the confidence and holy boldneſſe which the Saints have in comming unto God, is grounded upon the righteouſneſſe of Christ, not upon any worthineſſe in themſelves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>He that is moſt upright in heart, is moſt forward to acknowledge, and moſt conſtant in acknowledging his own unrighteouſneſſe.</hi> They who are moſt proud, are moſt empty. And they who have leaſt, uſually ſpeak with the moſt. Sincerity rates it ſelf low, <hi>I am not right,</hi> that is, <hi>righteous,</hi> ſaith upright <hi>Iob.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, (Say others) <hi>I am not right in my ſelf;</hi> that is, I am at preſent uncompoſed and unſetled in my own ſpirit: As if <hi>Iob</hi> had ſaid, <hi>I deſire that the Lord would remove his fear and mitigate my afflictions, that I might speak with him and not fear, for as yet I am not right in my ſelf, my spirit is ſo overwhelmed, and my thoughts
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:51057:207"/> are ſo troubled within me,</hi>

I am ſcarce in my right minde, but rather as a man diſtracted</hi> (ſo was <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) with the terrours of the Lord, I know not how to manage faith under ſuch fears, the majeſty and dreadfulneſſe of God oppreſſe my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as I am, I am not myſelf.</hi> The Vulgar gives this interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inſtead of a tranſlation, <hi>For I cannot anſwer while I am afraid.</hi> Hence note,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A godly man in ſore temptaions, may for a while appear leſſe then a man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fears hinder him from ſhewing the beſt of his naturall ſelf, much more any thing of his ſpirituall ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Further, note two things, experienced by many of the Saints in the day of their diſtreſſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>A godly man under greateſt afflictions keeps to the opinion of his own integrity, yet builds his comfort upon the free grace of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He can, according to the firſt interpretation of theſe words, challenge all with this Queſtion, <hi>Am I not right in my ſelf?</hi> Is there not integrity in my ſpirit? And according to the ſecond, he is ready to make this negative confeſſion, <hi>I am not right in my ſelf,</hi> I ſtand not upon my own integrity.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Saints in great afflictions are often ſo overwhelmed with the majeſty of God, that they are not able to expreſſe their intereſt in God, much leſſe make out the comforts of that intereſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The former of theſe ariſes from that ſeed of holineſſe and ſtock of grace abiding in them. The other ariſeth from the naturall weakneſſe of fleſh and bloud, in which they abide, and from the morall corruption of nature, abiding in them.</p>
                     <p>Thus we ſee how the ſenſe of the text riſes, as the word <hi>[Chen]</hi> is underſtood nominally, for <hi>right or just.</hi> We tranſlate it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbially, <hi>But it is not ſo with me;</hi> or, <hi>For it is not ſo with me.</hi> This reading bears a three-fold interpretation.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, In conſtruction with the former words, thus, <hi>Let him take away his rod,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then will I ſpeak, and not fear him, for it is not ſo with me;</hi> that is, I am not ſo fearfull, or of ſo low a ſpirit, I am not ſuch a ſtranger, or of ſo little acquaintance with God, that I ſhould not know how to ſpeak unto him, or that I ſhould be afraid to ſpeak unto him. If the Lord would but hide that brightneſſe of his own glory, which dazles me, and eaſe me of my own pains, which diſtract me, I ſhould ſure enough ſpeak unto him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                     <p>But ſecondly, We may rather refer it to the falſe and unkinde opinion of his friends, who judged him a wicked man, or an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, which here he denies, <hi>It is not ſo with me;</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>If the Lord would be pleaſed to grant what I have petitioned, I would ſpeak unto him without fear or doubt of being heard, for it is not ſo with me, namely, as you have ſuſpected and imagined all this while, or as you think it is. I am not the man you take, or rather miſtake me to be, if I were, then though the Lord ſhould take all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions from me, and all with-draw his terrours, yet I ſhould be afraid to speak unto him; yea I ſhould be afraid to pray unto him, every prayer (were I wicked) would be a praying down judgement upon my ſelf: But ſeeing I can boldly affirm, my conſcience alſo bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me witneſſe, that though I ſinne, yet I love not to ſinne, that though I am weak, yet I am not wicked, as ye have charged me;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Non ſic impius ego apud me. <hi>Pagn.</hi> Non ſum talis qualem me pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis. <hi>Vatabl. Merc.</hi>

                        <hi>my heart being thus clear before God, I cannot fear to open my mouth and report my cauſe before God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence obſerve (which hath been offered from other paſſages in this book, and therefore I ſhall only obſerve it,) That</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A godly man ſtandeth to, and knoweth his own integrity in the midst of all the clamours and ſlanders, the miſapprehenſions or asperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of friends or enemies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whoſoever loads and charges him with ſtudied or approved hypocriſie, he will (and he ought to) unload and diſcharge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (at leaſt) with <hi>Jobs</hi> plain deniall; you ſuſpect me thus, but I am ſure, <hi>it is not ſo with me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The words may bear this meaning, I have ſought and earneſtly entreated the Lord to abate my afflictions, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his terrours, <hi>But it is not ſo with me;</hi> Alas, I doe not finde that the Lord hath done any of theſe things for me. His rod is ſtill upon my back, and his terrours ſtand as thick about my ſoul as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: was ever poor man in ſuch a plight as I? Tis not (alaſſe) with me, as I have praied, or as I would have it. The rod ſmarts, and terrours amaze me ſtill. Hence note,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That a godly man may pray in affliction, and not preſently be relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in or from his affliction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many a ſoul can ſay, It is ſo with me, as I have praied, I have the wiſhes and deſires of my ſoul: yet many (and I believe many more then can) cannot ſay ſo. The Lord lets precious praiers lie unanſwered to our ſenſe. We may pray long before we finde it ſo with us, as we have praied, and yet thoſe praiers are not loſt,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:51057:208"/> but laid up; not buried, but ſown. And it becomes us to have pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, till the harveſt, though it be a late one.</p>

But abating that exceſſe of his tongue and ſpirit, his <hi>complaints</hi> are knit up with ſolid arguments, and his <hi>Queries</hi> put the point reſolutely, yet humbly, home to God himſelf: that he would be pleaſed to ſhew the reaſon of his preſent dealings, and why he varied ſo much from what he had done in former times.</p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:51057:209"/>
                  <p>The firſt verſe gives us a generall ground of this and of all his ſorrowfull complaints, The weariſomeneſſe of his life,
<q>My ſoul is weary of my life, I will leave my complaint upon my ſelf.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The argument may be formed thus;
<q>
                        <p>He hath reaſon to complain of his afflictions, whoſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are ſo heavy upon him, and ſo bitter, that he hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be weary of his very life.</p>
                        <p>But thus my caſe ſtands, my afflictions are ſo bitter to, and heavy upon me, that I am weary of my life.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I have reaſon to complain.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The aſſumption of this ſyllogiſme is contained in the firſt words of the verſe, <hi>My ſoul is weary of my life.</hi> And the concluſion in the latter; <hi>Therefore I will leave my complaint upon my ſelf, I will speak in the bitterneſſe of my ſoul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>My ſoul is weary of my life.</q>
                  <p>Life and ſoul are often in Scripture put promiſcuouſly for the ſame, but here they differ. The ſoul may be taken two waies.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Strictly, as it is oppoſed to the body.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In a more large ſenſe (by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> of the part for the whole) for the whole man conſiſting of body and ſoul: If ſo here, then the meaning of <hi>Job</hi> in ſaying <hi>[My ſoul is weary of my life]</hi> is no more but this, <hi>I (Job) am weary of my life;</hi> that is, of the marriage or union of my ſoul and body, O that this band (which I (though moſt are grieved at the weakneſſe of theirs) finde too ſtrong) were broken, or a bill of divorce granted for their ſeparation. Life is the band or tie by which ſoul and body ſubſiſt together. And when that band is broken or cut aſunder by the ſtroke of death, the body goes to the grave, and the ſoul or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit returns to God who gave it.</p>
                  <p>Again, When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>My ſoul is weary of my life.</hi> Life may be taken either for the act of life, and ſo the ſenſe is, <hi>I am weary of living;</hi> or it may be taken for the manner of life, and ſo the ſenſe is, <hi>I am weary of that courſe or ſtate of life wherein I am.</hi> Life is often put (not ſtrictly for the act of living, but) for the ſtate or condition in which a man lives, or with which life is cloathed; The circumſtances and concomitants of life are called life. Thus in our common ſpeech, when a man is in miſery, another ſaith, <hi>I would not have his life,</hi> or <hi>what a life hath he?</hi> The Apoſtles chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:51057:209" rendition="simple:additions"/> of all naturall men, is, that they are <hi>alienated from the life of God</hi> (Epheſ. 4.18.) that is, they cannot endure to live ſuch a life as God lives, or as he commands them to live, they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be holy, as he is holy, or holy, as he cals them to be holy, in all manner of converſation. Thus <hi>Job</hi> was alienated from his own life, I (ſaith he) <hi>am weary of my life;</hi> that is, of a life thus imbittered, thus afflicted.</p>
                  <q>My ſoul is weary.</q>
                  <p>The word which we tranſlate <hi>[weary]</hi> varies the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this ſentence. It ſignifies properly to be <hi>weakned,</hi>

But it is moſt commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to that wearineſſe which ariſes from the diſpleaſedneſſe or irkſomneſſe of our mindes. All burdens upon the body are light, compared with thoſe which reach the ſoul. Three things weary and load the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The filth and guilt of our own ſins. <hi>I will ſprinkle you</hi> (ſaith the Lord, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31.) <hi>with clean water,</hi> &amp;c. What's the effect of this? It follows, <hi>Then ſhall you remember your own evil waies, and loath or be weary of your ſelves</hi> (it is this word) <hi>becauſe of all your abominations.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, before I change your hearts, ye ſinne, and are not wear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of your ſins, nay, ye make a ſport of, and dally with them: But when I ſhall work that great change upon your hearts, your opinion and apprehenſions of ſin will change too: nothing will be ſo bitter or burdenſome, ſo unpleaſant or weariſome to your ſouls as ſinne. <hi>Fools make a mock of ſin; they who are truly wiſe, mourn and groan under the ſenſe and weight of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The unſutableneſſe and perverſeneſſe of other mens manners or diſpoſitions weary the ſoul, <hi>The righteous ſoul of Lot was vexed from day to day in ſeeing and hearing the unrighteous deeds of the debauched Sodomites</hi> (2 Pet. 2.8.) The ſoul of God is ſaid to be wearied by ſuch courſes of the ſons of men (Pſal. 95.10.) <hi>Fourty years long was I grieved, or wearied, with that generation.</hi> The Lord (as we may ſpeak with reverence) was even weary of his life, he had ſuch a troubleſome people to deal with; they grieved him at the heart (as the old world did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.6.) and were a heavy burden to his Spirit. That's the Apoſtles language, in his deſcription of
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:51057:210"/> that peoples frowardneſſe, and of Gods patience towards them (<hi>Act.</hi> 13.18.<note place="margin">

Thus alſo he reproves the ſame people by the Prophet (Iſa. 43.24.) <hi>Thou haſt wearied me with thine iniquities.</hi> And Chriſt (though by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word) ſpeaks the ſame thing of his own Diſciples (<hi>Mark</hi> 9.19.<note place="margin">

                        </gap>are ſum.</note>Secondly, The word is tranſlated by divers of the learned Rabbies, <hi>To cut, yea to cut off,</hi> as with a ſword, or any other edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtrument: Theſe render <hi>Jobs</hi> minde thus, <hi>My ſoul is cut off in me;</hi> or, <hi>My ſoul is cut off from my life;</hi> As if he had ſaid, My daies are at an end, I am ready to die, the threed of my life is cut, I am but a dead man. While life continues, ſoul and body are as it were one peece, but death divides them; or the recourſe of night and day, runs the threed of time thorow our lives, till our web (longer or ſhorter) be finiſhed, and then the threed is cut. To which ſimilitude <hi>Hezekiah</hi> alludes in his mourning death-bed ſong, as he ſuppoſed (Iſa. 38.10, 12.) <hi>I ſaid in the cutting off of my daies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mine age is removed from me, as a ſhepherds tent, I have cut off like a Weaver my life, he will cut me off with pining ſickneſſe,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:51057:210"/> or from the thrum,</hi> which being woond about the beam, the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver having finiſhed his work, cuts the web off from it. The ſame word in the Hebrew ſignifies pining ſickneſſe, and a thrum, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the thinneſſe and weakneſſe of it. My life (ſaith <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>) is ſpent, I am at the very laſt caſt, the yern of time is all wrought off, therefore my life is ready to be cut off. I am a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer upon death, and to be numbred among the dead, rather then among the living. Such a ſenſe this reading gives the text of <hi>Job, My ſoul is cut off from my life.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The word ſignifies a reluctance or diſplicency of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ariſing from the ſight and ſenſe of that which is very loathſome, filthy, and of an evil ſavour. It anſwers the Greek work render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Abomination</hi> (Matth. 24.15.) <hi>The abomination of deſolation;</hi> he means the <hi>Romans,</hi> who being Idolaters, their worſhip was abominable, and who being Lords of the world, their power was formidable, and laid all countries waſte and deſolate, which oppoſed them, or which they had a minde to oppoſe. And ſo when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>My ſoul is weary of my life;</hi> his meaning is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thus, My ſoul refuſes to inhabit, or to act ſo filthy a body as mine; My ſoul loaths to dwell, or ſtay any longer in this naſty lodging: As <hi>David</hi> (Pſal. 120.5.) ſpeaks of his wearineſſe in dwelling amongſt wicked men, becauſe of their morall filthineſſe, or the pollution of their mindes and waies. <hi>Woe is me that I ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ in Meſhec; that I dwell in the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nts of Kedar;</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to ſpeak, in reference to the naturall pollution and filthineſſe of his own body. <hi>Woe is me that I ſojourn in ſuch a diſeaſed body, and dwell (which yet will not die) in ſuch a dying careaſe. The no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tenant, my ſoul, is wearie of ſtaying in ſuch a ſtinking and filthy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, and I perceive (for I have moved him hitherto in vain) the great land-lord will neither repair it, nor as yet let it fall.</hi> As then, a man, who lives in an ill or incommodious houſe, ſaith, <hi>I am weary of dwelling in it;</hi> or as a man that hath a filthy garment, ſaith,<note place="margin">R <hi>Moyſes</hi> cum alijs Hebraeis doctoribus exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimat propriam vocis ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem eſse, liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare aut con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendere.

                  <p>Fourthly, Many of the Jewiſh Doctors tell us that the moſt ſtrict and proper ſignification of this word, is, <hi>To contend or ſtrive, to chide or wrangle</hi> (we may give it in that homely language.) As if the meaning of <hi>Job</hi> were, <hi>My ſoul doth even contend, chide and wrangle with my life, my ſoul conteſts and disputes the matter with my life, why it will not end, that I may get out from this body of mine,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:51057:211"/> and goe beyond the reach of theſe afflictions.</hi> The 95. Pſalm, verſ. 10. is ſo tranſlated,<note place="margin">Litigavi, <hi>Pag</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Fourty years long did I contend, chide or conteſt angerly with that generation:</hi> The Lord did often chide with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and they uſed to chide with <hi>Moſes;</hi> whence one place was called <hi>Meribah,</hi> yea, through their unbelief they did chide with God himſelf, and (there is no reaſon duſt and aſhes ſhould have the laſt word) God alſo gave them their chidings, and told them plainly their <hi>own,</hi> more then once. Thus the ſoul of <hi>Job</hi> chid his life, what's the reaſon that I am held in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, why wilt not thou be gone, that I may be at reſt? Carnall men chide with their lives for haſtening ſo faſt away, becauſe they know of no reſt, or have hope of none hereafter. A godly man may be brought to chide with his life for making no more haſte away, becauſe he findes none, or ſo little reſt here. <hi>Elihu</hi> (Ch. 33.19) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing in the method which God uſes to humble proud man, ads, <hi>He is chastened alſo with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with ſtrong pains;</hi> He is chaſtened; the word ſignifies alſo reproving, or convincing by arguments, and that in a quick and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, as well as in a rationall and ſolid way. Now, while affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions chidingly ſmite us, we are apt to chide them, and give them at leaſt a word for a blow. <hi>Job</hi> did not only chide with his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but with his life, becauſe it would not depart and be gone, being ſo unkindly uſed and imbittered by afflictions. His ſoul did even chide his life out a doors.</p>

                     <hi>Job</hi> complained in the third Chapter, he complained at the ſixth and ſeventh Chapters, he erred twice, yea thrice upon this point before, yet now we hear him complaining, as if he had not complained at all. This was <hi>Jobs</hi> infirmity: though ſomewhat hath, and more may be ſaid to take off thoſe aſperſions which his friends caſt upon him for complaining, yet no doubt it was his ſinne to complain; eſpecially to break out ſo often, and in ſuch bitter complainings. Hence obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A godly man may (poſſibly) fall often into the ſame ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where grace taketh hold of the heart, it breaks the cuſtom and ſpoils the trade of ſinne; yet a godly man may ſinne over the ſame ſinne, and renew the ſame tranſgreſſion. The trade of ſinne is ſpoiled, when the ſoul leaves deviſing, plotting, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſinne, which acts denominate a worker of iniquity. The cuſtom of ſinne is broken, when though the ſame ſinne be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted again, yet the ſoul puts in it's plea and complaint againſt it. 'Tis here as in civil things, if we make our challenge or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, the cuſtom is gone, though the acts be renewed by the power and prevalency of the oppoſite party; yet, when I ſay a godly man may fall into ſinne often, I mean not of groſſe and ſcandalous ſins; God doth not let his people fall often into the mire. <hi>Noah</hi> was not often drunk, nor did <hi>David</hi> commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery often, or more then once. The grace of God which bringeth ſalvation, teacheth us to deny ungodlineſſe and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſts. And if a godly man fall often into any the leaſt ſin, yet he lies not in ſinne, becauſe he renews repentance, as often as he ſins, and riſes as often as he fals: he reſolves (through the ſtrength of Chriſt) never to ſinne, when through his own weakneſſe, and the violence of temptation, he is ſoon after over-taken or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd with ſinne. <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth (Pſal. 119.30.) <hi>I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the way of truth;</hi> His election was <hi>truth;</hi> truth of heart, which is oppoſed to hypocriſie; truth of judgement, which is oppoſed to errour; and truth of ſpeech, which is oppoſed to lying; yet he ſlipt with his tongue, more then once, and told an untruth, more then one. He cannot be acquitted from this failing, when he anſwered <hi>Ahimelech</hi> the Prieſt, <hi>The King hath commanded me a buſineſſe, and hath ſaid unto me, Let not any man know any thing
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:51057:212"/> of the buſineſſe whereabout I ſend thee, and what I have commanded thee; and I have appointed my ſervants to ſuch a place</hi> (1 Sam. 21.2.) He again faulters with his tongue, and ſpeaks either falſly or doubtfully, when the King of the Philiſtines asked him, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ye made a rode to day? And David ſaid, againſt the South of Iudah,</hi> &amp;c. (1 Sam. 27.10.) <hi>when as his invaſion was againſt the Geſhurites, and the Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He that overcame the Bear, the Lion, and <hi>Goliah</hi> the Giant, is overcome by fear, and the mother of it unbelief. <hi>Davids</hi> example ſhould be no encouragement, ſhall be no excuſe to thoſe who willingly fall often into the ſame ſinne. A good man is not priviledg'd from doing it, but no man is priviledg'd to doe it. Such exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples muſt not teach us to ſinne, but they teach us how unable we (alone) are to keep our ſelves from ſinne: they teach us alſo, what need we have to depend upon, and look up to Chriſt, that we may be kept from ſin: if he leave us but a little unto our ſelves, the fleſh will diſcover much of it ſelf, and we ſhall quickly ſhew what our natures are, though we are renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by grace. <hi>We muſt truſt to the ſupplies, not to the receipts of grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith <hi>[My ſoul is weary of my life.]</hi> We learn; That</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Soul and life in man are two diſtinct things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For howſoever (as was toucht in explication) the ſoul is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en put for the whole man, and ſo the ſenſe of, <hi>my ſoul is weary,</hi> may be but this, I am weary of my life: yet the holy Ghoſt would never denominate all man by that, which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> not a part of man. That's a brutiſh opinion which makes the ſoul nothing, or nothing elſe but life, and this life no more in entity then the life of a beaſt, which vaniſheth, when it dieth. That theſe opinion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts tell us, they believe the body ſhall riſe again by the power of God, cannot ſatisfie for this fall, which their opinion gives the ſoul: neither doth the immortality of the ſoul at all contradict, (which was threatned for, and is the wages of ſin) the death of the whole man. For death conſiſts not (if we may ſay a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation doth conſiſt) in the annihilation, but in the ſeparation of thoſe parts of man, ſoul and body, which by life are united and kept cloſe together.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>My ſoul is weary of my life,</hi> we learn,</p>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:51057:212"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the life of man may grow to be a burthen to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the third Chapter <hi>Job</hi> wiſhed for death, his wiſh was exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined there, about the lawfulneſſe of it, I ſhall now only exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine (a touch about which was given lately) whence this weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life cauſing wiſhes to be rid of life doth ariſe. There is a wearineſſe of life incident only, and proper to wicked men. And there is a wearineſſe of life, which may grow upon the beſt of men. Take a brief account of the uſuall grounds of both.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Carnall men are often ſick with diſcontent, and die of a humour: If the Lord will not give them their luſts, they bid him take their lives. Neceſſaries and competencies will not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, they muſt have ſuperfluities; they languiſh, if they have not quails to their Manna, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> once deſired and had. Was it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but this, which made <hi>Ahab</hi> goe home ſullen and ſad? Sullen ſadneſſe is a degree of this wearineſſe. <hi>Ahab</hi> had a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and yet he could not live without a vineyard. <hi>He that takes away another mans life to obtain what he deſires, thinkes his own life ſearee deſirable, unleſſe he may obtain it.</hi> There was a ſpice of this diſtemper in <hi>Jonah,</hi> though a good man, and a Prophet (<hi>Jonah</hi> 4.8.) becauſe the Lord did but kill his gourd, kill me too, ſaith <hi>Ionah, He wiſhed himſelf to die, and ſaid</hi> (his gourd being dead) <hi>It is better for me to die then to live.</hi> It is an exceſſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, when we deſire any outward thing (much more when we deſire things unneceſſary, things not to ſupply our wants, but to ſerve our luſts) As <hi>Rachel</hi> did children (who are the beſt and nobleſt of outward things) <hi>Give me them, or elſe I die,</hi> (Gen. 30.1.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Some wicked men are wearied of their lives by the horrour of their conſciences. A hell within, makes the world without a hell too. They who have a ſight of eternall death (as the wages of ſin) without the ſight of a remedy may ſoon be weary of a temporall life. As much peace of conſcience and ſoul joy in believing, makes ſome of the Saints wiſh themſelves out of the body; ſo alſo doth trouble of conſcience, and grief of ſoul make many of the wicked. A man who is not at all wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of committing ſin may be weary of his life, becauſe he hath committed it. And he, who was never troubled that his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is as an offence againſt God, may feel his wickedneſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely offenſive againſt himſelf. To ſuch a ſoul the evil of ſinne is ſo great an evil of puniſhment, that he is ready to cry out with
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:51057:213"/> 
                     <hi>Cain, My puniſhment is greater then I can bear.</hi> Yea, what his guilty conſcience feared, comes to be the deſire of many under the ſame guilt, <hi>That every one that findeth them would ſlay them:</hi> And ſome are ſo weary of their lives at the ſight of ſinne, that they make away their lives themſelves, hoping to get out of the ſight of ſin. There are ſins which cry to God for vengeance, and ſome cry to the ſinner himſelf for vengeance. This cry was ſo loud and forcible in the ears of <hi>Judas,</hi> that it cauſed him to go away and hang himſelf. And what made <hi>Ahithophel</hi> weary of his life, but his wickedneſſe? The rejecting of his counſel was not ſo much the reaſon of it, as the ſinfulneſſe of his counſel: A good man may be troubled at others, when his good counſel is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, but he grows not unacceptable to himſelf; nay, he is well-pleaſed that he hath given honeſt counſel, though none will take it, though all are diſpleaſed at it. But they who aim not at the pleaſing of God in what they doe, thinke themſelves undone (and die they will) if they pleaſe not men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Inordinate cares for the things of this life, make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers weary of their lives. He that cannot caſt his care upon God, may ſoon be caſt down himſelf. Chriſt. (<hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34.) cautions his Diſciples, <hi>Take heed leſt your hearts be over-charged with the cares of this life.</hi> That which Chriſt would prevent in the Saints, fals often upon carnall men, their hearts are over-charged with cares, cares are compared to a burden, and they are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thorns, they doe not only preſſe, but vex and wound: Their weight preſſes ſome to death, their ſharpneſſe wounds o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to death: And not a few would go out of the world, becauſe they cannot get ſo much of it, as they would.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things (among others) make wicked men <hi>weary of their lives.</hi> There are other things which make godly men weary of their lives; ſuch are theſe,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The violence of Satans, and the worlds temptations. The ſoul would gladly be rid of the body, that it might be beyond the reach and aſſaults of the devil, and his aſſiſtants. There's a ſerpent every where, but in the heavenly paradiſe. <hi>Only they complain not of temptation, who are willing ſlaves to the tempter.</hi> The Apoſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.) aſſures the <hi>Corinthians, There hath no temptation taken you, but ſuch as is common to man; but God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation alſo make a way to eſcape, that ye
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:51057:213"/> may be able to bear it,</hi> as if he had ſaid, Temptations are ſore burdens, and although yours hitherto have been but ordinary temptations, ſuch as uſually befall the Saints, though yours be moderate afflictions, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> common ſtature, ſuch as in the eye of reaſon any man may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> with by a common aſſiſtance of grace; yet there are temptations, which (if God, the faithfull. God ſhould not come in with greater aſſiſtances then uſuall) you are not able to bear. <hi>They who wrestle with more then fleſh and bloud, alwaies need more then the ſtrength of fleſh and bloud to help them in their wrestlings.</hi> And becauſe they are often aſſaulted with greater ſtrength, therefore they are aſſiſted with greater ſtrength. For if God doe either with-draw his help from the Saints, or leave them to wreſtle with Satan alone, and to fight ſingle with his Armies, or if he doe, not proportion the aid he ſends to the temptation he permits, they are ſadly over-charged, though they can never be totally overcome; and 'tis poſſible to grow weary of the battell, though we are aſſured of the victory. <hi>It is the honour of the Saints to conquer, when they are tempted, but it is their happineſſe to be above or without temptation.</hi> How many poor ſouls put up bils of complaint, and beg praiers againſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations. <hi>Paul praid thrice,</hi> that is, often and much, <hi>when the meſſenger of Satan buffeted him:</hi> whether his were an inward or an outward temptation is doubted, but without doubt that tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made his life burdenſome to him, till he received that anſwer from God, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Saints are wearied with the weight of their ſinfull hearts. Inward corruption burdens more then outward temptation: and were it not for corruption within, temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without could not be very burdenſome: The devil tempted Chriſt, but becauſe he found <hi>nothing at all in him,</hi> complying with, or ſutable to his temptations; therefore Chriſt threw them off with eaſe. That enemy without could doe us no hurt (he might put us to ſome trouble) if he found no correſpondence within. The traitour in our own bowels, opens our ports, and lets in the adverſary. His ſparks could never enflame us, if he found no tindar in us. The baſeneſſe and unbelief, the luſts and vanities of our mindes are apt to take fire at every injection. <hi>A gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul cannot live here without ſinne, and yet can eaſier die then ſinne. Paul</hi> (Rom. 7.24.) cries out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death, or from this body of
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:51057:214"/> death!</hi> That is, <hi>from my body which is ſubject to death by reaſon of theſe remains of carnall corruption, or from my carnall corruptions, which are the remains of my ſpirituall death, and are worſe to me then any death.</hi> All the afflictions of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and the pains of his body, were but a play, and a kinde of ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> compared with the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which this body of death put him to. He rejoyced in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but he could not but mourn under corruption. Many poor ſouls are ſo vexed with theſe myſticall Canaanites, that their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Canaan (the ſtate of grace) is to them like Egypt, the land of their captivity. And when they are commanded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, they anſwer, if we could not ſin, we could rejoyce, <hi>How ſhall we ſing the Lords ſong in a ſtrange land?</hi> O that we might goe home.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Saints grow weary of their lives through the wickedneſſe of other mens lives, not only doe their own corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons burthen them, but (which ſhews the holineſſe of their hearts more) the corruptions of others. The ſinfulneſſe and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the times and places wherein they live, eſpecially of perſons they are related to, makes their lives grievous, and imbitters all their comforts. <hi>Rebekah</hi> that good woman, tels her husband <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> (Gen. 27.46.) <hi>I am weary of my life, becauſe of the daughters of Heth, for if Iacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, ſuch as theſe which are of the daughters of the land, What good ſhall my life doe me?</hi> The ſweetneſſe of my life is gone, if this ſon miſcarry, as his brother hath done before him. The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> cries out, O that I had in the wilderneſſe a lodging place of waifaring men, that I might leave my people, and go from them; What made him ſo weary of living among them? (and that was but a ſtep on this ſide, being weary of his life.) The next words ſhew us, <hi>They be all adulterers, an aſſembly of treacherous men</hi> (Jer. 9.2.) Better be in a waſte wilderneſſe among vvilde beaſts, then in a populous City, among beaſtly men. 'Tis a part of our compleat happineſſe in heaven, that vve ſhall have no ill neighbours there. They vvho are evil can take pleaſure in thoſe who do evil. <hi>But the more holineſſe any one hath, the more is he burthened with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſſe of others.</hi> And that's the reaſon why God himſelf is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt to be ſo exceedingly burdened with the ſins of men, to be wearied and broken with them, to be laden with them, as a Cart with ſheaves, <hi>He is infinitely holy. Grieve not the holy Spirit of God</hi> (Epheſ. 4.30.) The Spirit is ſo holy, that ſin (which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſſe)
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:51057:214"/> grieves him preſently. And in proportion, look how much any man is more holy then others, by ſo much is he more afflicted with the impurity of others. As the holy Spirit of God, who is all holy: ſo the ſpirits of holy men (who yet have a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſin) cannot but be afflicted with the ſins of men.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Some of the Saints would part with this life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have got ſuch aſſurance and evidence of a better life. When much of eternall life appears to a godly man, he is weary of a temporall life. Naturall things are but burdenſome trifles to thoſe who are ſtored with ſpirituall. Chriſt ſaith (<hi>Luk.</hi> 5.39.) <hi>No man having drunke old wine, ſtraight way deſireth new, for he ſaith the old is better:</hi> He that taſtes what is better then he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes, is unſatisfied with all he enjoyes. We can hardly be perſwaded what we have is good, when we ſee better of the ſame kinde. How much more hardly is this perſwaſion wrought in us, that earthly things (which differ in kinde from heavenly) are any great good, when heavenly things are open before us. When the Diſciples (at the transfiguration) had but a glimpſe of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, They ſay, <hi>It is good to be here, Let us build three tabernacles.</hi> They do not ſpeak comparatively, as if now they had met with ſomewhat, better then ever they had before; but poſitively, as if they had never met with any good before. When the Spirit car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Saints into his wine-cellar, and gives them a draught of everlaſting conſolations, the wine of worldly comforts will not down; they begin to diſreliſh the dainties and delicacies of the creature. A true ſight of heaven makes the earth ſcarce worth the looking after, or the living in. Such live, becauſe God will have them live to doe him ſervice, not becauſe they deſire to live to ſerve their own ends. <hi>Paul</hi> was in a great ſtraight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23.) whether he ſhould depart or abide in the fleſh: but the ſtraight was not in reference to himſelf, he was aſſured, dying would be to him, but a travelling to Chriſt, and therefore death was to him an eaſie election. His ſtraight was only this, whether he ſhould not abide ſtill in the fleſh, to to ſupply the needs of the Church, and forbear glory a while, that he might prepare others for glory. The ſame Apoſtle (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4.) ſaith in the firſt verſe, <hi>We know that if the earthly houſe of this tabernacle be diſſolved, we have a building of God, an houſe made without hands, eternall in the heavens.</hi> When their faith was thus upon the wing, ſoaring up to the aſſurance of <hi>an houſe
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:51057:215"/> made without hands;</hi> they grew weary of their ſmoaky cottages preſently; they could not endure to live in thoſe poor lodges, corruptible bodies, having a view of ſuch glorious pallaces; therefore he adds, <hi>In this we groan earneſtly, deſiring to be clothed upon with our houſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>which is from heaven.</hi> The word ſignifies groaning, as a man that hath a weighty burden lying upon him, which makes him fetch his winde even from his bowels. The body is the burden, rather then the houſe or the clothing of the ſoul, when once the ſoul knows it ſhall be clothed with an houſe, which is from heaven. As (I ſaid before) much of hell in this life makes wicked men vveary of this life, ſo alſo doth much of heaven.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cic.</hi> in <hi>Tuſcul.</hi> Queſt de Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ombroto.</note> The Roman Oratour tels us, that a young man, who lived in great proſperity, having read <hi>Plato</hi> about the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the ſoul, was ſo affected, that he threw himſelf vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently from a high wall into the ſea, that he might have a proof of that immortality, by his experience of it. The Goſpel forbids ſuch haſte, and knows no ſuch vvaies to happineſſe. As Chriſt (not vve) hath purchaſed that eſtate; ſo Chriſt muſt lead us (we muſt not thruſt our ſelves) into the poſſeſſion of it: but yet the earneſts, the fore-taſtes and firſt-fruits of heaven, which the Saints finde in this life (though they be ſuch as eat the marrow and fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſuch as may have the very cream and ſpirits of the creature to live upon) make them groan often and earneſtly for the next life. <hi>This is good, but heaven is better.</hi>

                  <p>Laſtly, Which is the caſe of this text, the Saints may grow vveary of their lives from the outward afflictions and troubles of this life. Sickneſſe and pains upon the body, poverty and vvant in the eſtate, reproaches and unkindeneſſes put upon our perſons, vvith a thouſand evils to vvhich this life is ſubject every day, cauſe many to vviſh and long for an end of their daies. And though they are ready to ſubmit to the vvill of God, if he have appointed them to a longer conflict vvith theſe evils, yet they cannot but ſhew their vvilligneſſe, yea their gladneſſe to part vvith their lives, that they may part vvith ſuch troubles accompaning their lives.</p>
                  <p>And as the afflictions of the body naturall, ſo of the body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike may make them vveary of their lives. How many in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have been ſo vvearied vvith hearing the voice of the oppreſſour, that they have vviſhed themſelves in their graves, only to get out of their hearing. And vvith us, ſince
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:51057:215"/> theſe troubles began, have not many been tired with living? Have they not cried after death, and wooed the grave, as being weary of the world? The Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.2.) ſpeaks of a weary land. <hi>A man</hi> (meaning Chriſt) <hi>ſhall be as the ſhadow of a great rock in a weary land.</hi> The land it ſelf (being inſenſible) could not be weary; but he cals it <hi>a weary land,</hi> becauſe the inhabitants living in the land, were wearied with the troubles and continuall vexations which they found there. In theſe caſes the ſoul of a believer ſtands (like <hi>Abraham</hi> when the Angels paſſed by) at the tent door of his body, ready to come forth, looking when God will but call, yea, he cries out, that he may be called (in the language of <hi>Job) My ſoul is weary of my life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>I will leave my complaint upon my ſelf, I will speak in the bitterneſſe of my ſoul.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will leave,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, I will carry my complaint no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it ſhall trouble none but my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The originall ſignifies alſo to ſtrengthen or fortifie (<hi>Nehem.</hi> 3.8) <hi>They fortified Jeruſalem unto the broad wall;</hi> we put in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; <hi>They left Jeruſalem to the broad wall:</hi> So the ſenſe of <hi>Job</hi> may be this, My pains do not abate, but increaſe, why then ſhould I remit or abate my complaint, I will ſtrengthen my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint as long as my ſorrows are ſtrengthened.</p>
                  <q>My complaint.</q>
                  <p>That word hath been explained before, it ſignifies an inward, as well as an outward complaint, and that moſt properly. Some tranſlate it ſo here, <hi>I will groan in ſilence with my ſelf.</hi>

                     </note> But the text requires, rather that we interpret it of an externall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, formed up into words. The Septuagint are expreſſe, and ſo is <hi>Auſtin, I will leave my words upon my ſelf:</hi> both interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it of a vocall declaration of his minde and meaning.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt difficulty lies in thoſe words <hi>[upon my ſelf]</hi> One renders, <hi>I will leave my complaint off, or lay it aſide from my ſelf.</hi> As if <hi>Iob</hi> meant to give over this work of complaining, and to compoſe his heart to quietneſſe, how unquiet ſoever his eſtate continued. But his following practice ſeems to confute this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, and to deny any ſuch intention.</p>
                  <p>Others give this ſenſe, I will ſpeak at my own peril, and if any danger or inconvenience come of it, I will bear it my ſelf. I will
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:51057:216"/> run that venture. <hi>Job</hi> uſes ſuch language (<hi>chap.</hi> 13.13.) <hi>Hold your peace, let me alone that I may speak, and let come on me what will.</hi> We may gloſſe it with that heroicall reſolution of Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> (Eſth. 4.16.) <hi>So will I go in unto the King, which is not according to the Law, and if I periſh, I periſh.</hi> The Hebrew prepoſition hath various acceptions.</p>

                  <p>We may take in any of, or all theſe tranſlations. And from all, the meaning of <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to riſe thus, <hi>I intend not to ſpeak a word againſt God, I will not charge the Almighty with injuſtice, or with rigour, to doe which were highest wickedneſſe; I purpoſe indeed to complain, but I will complain only upon, or with my ſelf, concerning or againſt my ſelf, I will not utter a word againſt the wiſdome of God, or accuſe his providence. I will not ſhoot an arrow againſt heaven, or ſend out a murmur againſt the most high.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two waies of leaving our complaints upon ourſelves,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, When we let them lie wholly upon our ſelves, and will not go to God for ſtrength or patience to bear them. Who can ſufficiently mourn over them, who leave their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints in this ſenſe upon themſelves? It is ſinfull and fooliſh to leave our complaints thus upon our ſelves: 'Tis a duty to leave them upon God, and to pour them into the boſom of <hi>Christ,</hi> who can, and who only can either eaſe us of them, or make them eaſie to us: who can, and who only can take off our burdens, or enable us to carry them. The burden of our ordinary cares will break our backs, if left upon our ſelves; how then ſhall we in our own ſtrength ſtand under the burden of extreameſt ſorrows?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We leave our complaint upon our ſelves. When we make no excuſes or evaſions, but plainly charge the fault upon our ſelves. Thus we ought to leave all our complaints upon our ſelves. It is ſinfull and fooliſh to charge any of them wholly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the devil, or at all upon God. An honeſt heart takes them home, and ſaith, God is righteous, but I am a tranſgreſſour, what he hath done he may do, and he hath done juſtly in all that he hath done. This is the ſenſe of <hi>Iobs</hi> reſolution, <hi>I will leave my complaint upon my ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whatſoever a godly man ſuffereth, he will not charge God with it, but himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="427" facs="tcp:51057:216"/>
                  <p>He is more carefull of the honour of God, then of his own peace, and had rather die then the glory of God ſhould ſuffer. <hi>O Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 9.7.) <hi>righteouſneſſe belongeth unto thee, but unto us confuſion of face;</hi> And (verſ. 14.) <hi>the Lord is righteous in all his works which he doth, for we obeyed not his voice.</hi> When the Angel was ſmiting <hi>Iſrael</hi> with the plague of peſtilence, <hi>David</hi> beſpeaks the Lord in reference to the people, <hi>Loe, I have ſinned, and I have done wickedly; but theſe ſheep, What have they done? Let thine hand I pray thee be againſt me,</hi> &amp;c. (2 Sam. 24.17.) I take the blame to my ſelf, Lord, upon me let thy ſtroak be, even upon me, not upon <hi>Iſrael:</hi> So ſaith the ſoul, in reference unto God, upon me be the blame of all the troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I feel, not upon God, What hath God done? All that he hath done is right, and juſt, and good. <hi>It is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a holy frame of heart, to be often judging our ſelves, and alwaies acquitting of God:</hi> To be often complaining of our ſelves, and to be ever exalting God: To be alwaies thanking him for our comforts, and alwaies ſaying, we may thank our ſelves for our ſorrows. Whatſoever the Lord ſaith or doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us, we ſhould not only ſay with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (when a ſad meſſage was brought him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.19.) <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord,</hi> but alſo, Good are the works of the Lord. Many men are ready to lay their ſins (much more their ſorrows) upon God. So the Apoſtle repreſents them (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19.) <hi>Thou wilt ſay unto me, Why doth he then finde fault?</hi> Why doth God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of us? we have more reaſon to complain of, and charge our faults on God. If he hardeneth whom he will, Why are we blamed for being hardened? <hi>For who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> Thus they queſtion God, Who hath reſiſted thy will? whoſe lives are nothing elſe but a continued warre againſt, and reſiſtance of his will. They who ſtrive moſt to comply with the will of God, complain often of themſelves for reſiſting it. And though they know God hardeneth vvhom he vvill, yet they will not leave the hardening of any upon God, as his fault, but as his prerogative. They confeſſe it to be as great an act of holineſſe in God, to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſome men in ſin, as it is to ſoften others by his grace: Mercy appears chiefly in the one, juſtice appears chiefly in the other, but holineſſe equally in both.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="428" facs="tcp:51057:217"/>I will speak in the bitterneſſe of my ſoul.</q>
                  <p>A bitter ſoul bringeth forth bitter words. Out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the heart, the mouth ſpeaketh. If there be abundance of joy in the heart, the mouth will ſpeak joyfully; and if there be abundance of ſorrow in the heart, the mouth ſpeaks ſorrowful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.<note place="margin">Loquar quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid mihi affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio ſuggeſſerit.</note> As when there is abundance of filth in the heart, the mouth ſpeaks filthineſſe. We may ſee the lines and image of mans minde drawn upon his words. One man ſpeaks in the anger of his ſoul, and he ſpeaks angerly. Another ſpeaks in the pride of his ſoul, and he ſpeaks proudly. A third ſpeaks in the profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſoul, and he ſpeaks profanely. Again, one ſpeaks in the courage of his ſoul, and he ſpeaks couragiouſly. Another ſpeaks in the patience of his ſoul, and he ſpeaks patiently. A third ſpeaks in the faith of his ſoul, and he ſpeaks beleevingly. There is a neerneſſe to this ſenſe, in that of the ſixtieth Pſalm (<hi>verſ.</hi> 6.) <hi>God hath ſpoken in his holineſſe;</hi> and we are aſſured he cannot but ſpeak holily, who is <hi>all holy. I</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) will speak in the bitterneſſe of my ſoul,</hi> and he ſpake bitterly; his ſoul was bitter, and ſo was his ſpeech too.</p>
                  <p>What he means by the bitterneſſe of his ſoul, hath been open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heretofore, in the third Chapter, and in the ſeventh Chapter, verſ. 11. thither I refer the Reader.</p>
                  <p>In brief, <hi>I will ſpeak in the bitterneſſe of my ſoul,</hi> is either this, I will let out the ſorrows of my heart at my tongue, and it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by what I ſay, what I feel. Or</p>
                  <p>Further, <hi>I will ſpeak in the bitterneſſe of my ſoul,</hi> may be taken as an Apology for what he ſpake. As if he had ſaid, <hi>Doe not charge my complaint upon my own account,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">No<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mea futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ſunt verba, quam meae a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritudinis, haec enim impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat &amp; extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet orationem.</note> 
                     <hi>If I ſpeak bitterly, it is not I that speak, but the bitterneſſe that is in me.</hi> As <hi>Paul,</hi> when he did what he would not, pleads in the ſeventh of the <hi>Romans, It is no more I that doe it, but ſinne that dwelleth in me.</hi> It is not I <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle, not I regenerate <hi>Paul,</hi> but the remains of unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> a Phariſee, which rebell againſt the Law of God. In the ſame manner ſaith <hi>Iob</hi> here, and ſo ſay the Saints; Are we at any time impatient, and complain more then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth us, know it is not we that ſpeak, but the <hi>bitterneſſe of our hearts.</hi> The thing which we would not, that ſpeak we; and therefore it is not we that ſpeak, but the ſorrow that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in us.</p>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:51057:217"/>
                  <p>So then, ſpeaking in the bitterneſſe of the ſoul, notes either the exceſſe or greatneſſe of a complaint, or the cauſe and ſpring of a complaint. The complaints of <hi>Job</hi> came not from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary temper of his ſpirit, but from the troubles of his eſtate, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempering his ſpirit; he deſired rather to be praiſing and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying God for his receits, then complaining over his own wants. But his wants were ſuch, as he could not refrain from complaining <hi>I will ſpeak in the bitterneſſe of my ſoul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what ſpeaks he?</p>
                  <p>As when he firſt ſpake theſe words (<hi>Chap.</hi> 7.11.) he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned his ſpeech to God, deſiring him to deal more ſweetly with him, and puts the queſtion, <hi>Am I a Sea or a Whale?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>So here, after he hath ſet forth his reſolvedneſſe to complain, he preſently turns his ſpeech to God, imploring favour, <hi>I will ſay unto God, doe not condemn me</hi> (verſ. 2.) and he puts the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion (verſ. 3.) <hi>Is it good unto thee that thou ſhouldeſt oppreſſe?</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord, I cannot but complain of my condition, and I muſt take the boldneſſe to complain to thee; but I will not complain of thee, as if thou wert mine enemy; nor will I contend with thee, as if thou wert a party, my meaning and ſcope is only this, to ſupplicate thee as my Judge. I will ſay unto God, Doe not condemn me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, We may take the words as a plain deprecation, <hi>Doe not condemn me;</hi> The Hebrew is litterally thus rendered, <hi>Doe not wicked me,</hi> that is, <hi>Doe not count me, or caſt me for a wicked man.</hi> But did the Lord account <hi>Iob</hi> as a wicked man? Or had <hi>Job</hi> an opinion that the Lord did account him ſo? Surely <hi>Job</hi> had good (yet humble) thoughts of himſelf, though he endured ſo many evils, yea he was perſwaded that the Lord (who laid thoſe evils on him) had good thoughts of him too: and when he ſaith, <hi>Doe not condemn me,</hi> doubtleſſe he had hopes, poſſibly he had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances that the Lord had juſtified and acquitted him; why then reſolves he, <hi>I will ſay unto God, Doe not condemn me?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, We may expound him thus, Lord, Doe not that againſt me, which may give the world occaſion to condemn me; or, Lay not thy hand ſo heavily upon me, leſt they that underſtand not the reaſon of thy dealings, ſhould be occaſioned to adjudge me wicked: Though <hi>Job</hi> had a witneſſe above, and a record on high, though he knew his reputation was unblemiſhed before God in the midſt of all theſe breaches upon his family, and botches upon his body, yet he knew men would condemn him as guilty of the moſt notorious evils of ſin, when they ſaw him languiſhing under ſuch unparallel'd evils of puniſhment. This moved him to pray, Lord, do not condemn me, by making me an object of the worlds condemnation.</p>
                     <p>Again, The words <hi>(Doe not condemn me)</hi> may have this meaning, Lord,<note n="*" place="margin">Permitto reru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aliarum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And 'tis very uſuall with men to do ſo; we think we could bear any affliction but that, or better then that, which is upon us. Yet <hi>Job</hi> had great reaſon to chuſe any affliction rather then this. He might well ſay, I can (through thy grace enabling me) bear theſe or any other pains of my body, and loſſes in my eſtate, but I know not how to bear the loſſe of mine innocency, or the reproach of being thrown out of thy favour. The world, and theſe my friends will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their miſapprehenſions of me, if thou doeſt not ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliver me, and confute their raſh jugement by ſome eminent mercy.</p>
                     <p>Condemnation hath three things in it, which make it grievous.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The penalty of the ſentence.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The disfavour of the Judge.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The ſtain of his integrity who is condemned. To have but ſo much as a ſuſpition or jealouſie of the diſpleaſure of God, afflicts the ſpirit of a godly man, more then all his other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. Though <hi>Job</hi> had a ſure intereſt in the favour of God, and was freed from the penalty of condemnation, by his union with Chriſt; yet ſometimes clouds and darkneſſe came over him, and the terrours of the Lord did fight againſt him, which cauſed thoſe ſad lamentations in the ſixth Chapter: but here he is chiefly troubled at the ſtain of his integrity in the eye of the world, who beholding his afflictions, blotted him as a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, and eſteemed him forſaken of God, even utterly diſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and caſt out of his ſight. Obſerve hence,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That, <hi>Great afflictions carry a charge of wickedneſſe upon the afflicted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> having eſcaped death in a wreck at ſea, could not eſcape a hard cenſure at land, when a viper was ſeen upon his hand: <hi>This man</hi> (ſay thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> of <hi>Melita</hi> among themſelves) <hi>is no doubt a murderer, whom though he hath eſcaped the ſea, yet ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance ſuffereth not to live</hi> (Act. 28.4.) We finde alſo that thoſe exemplary judgements which befell the <hi>Galileans,</hi> whoſe bloud <hi>Pilate</hi> had mingled with their ſacrifices (it ſeems he cauſed them to be ſlain, while they offered ſacrifice) and thoſe upon whom the Tower of <hi>Siloe</hi> fell, left them all under a charge of higheſt wickedneſſe; elſe Chriſt had not taken it off, ſaying, <hi>Suppoſe ye that thoſe Galileans were ſinners above all the Galileans, becauſe they
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:51057:219"/> ſuffered ſuch things? or thoſe eighteen upon whom the Tower of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe fell, thinke ye that they were ſinners above all that dwelt in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem?</hi> As if he had ſaid, I, who know your thoughts, know ye are ready to think ſo. It is a very ill, but it is a very common thing, to judge both of perſons and of cauſes by ſucceſſe. Doth a man gain and thrive in the world; here's a man ſure whom God loves, ſaith the world. Though a <hi>Jeremy</hi> can ſay, <hi>Why doth the way of the wicked proſper?</hi> He can ſee them to be wicked tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all their proſperity; yet, how often are they accounted righteous, who proſper; and good, who enjoy good? But doth a man wither and go down the winde in the world? He's a man ſure whom God hates, ſaith the world. Man is apt to think them the worſt, who ſuffer worſt, and that they have ſinned moſt who have moſt ſorrow. The Prophet (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4, 5.) fore-tels that Chriſt himſelf, <hi>While he bore our griefs, and carried our ſorrows, ſhould be eſteemed ſtricken, ſmitten of God and afflicted.</hi> Chriſt was eſteemed a great ſinner, when God gave him up to be ſmitten for ſinners; therefore he adds, <hi>but he was wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, obſerve, <hi>The displeaſure of God is more grievous to the Saints, then all other preſſures and ſorrows whatſoever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> ſaith not, Lord do not afflict me, do not chaſten me, lay not thine hand upon me any more, but <hi>Lord do not condemn me.</hi> It is infinitely worſe to be condemned, then to be chaſtened, yea then to be killed. Condemnation carries in it an argument of disfavour, and that makes it ſo burdenſome. As the love of God is better to us, then all the good things of this life (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6.) <hi>Many will ſay, Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> This is the great query of the world: but what ſaith <hi>David, Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us; thou haſt put gladneſſe in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine encreaſed.</hi> And as the favour of God is better to us then the good things of this life, ſo then life, which is better then all earthly goods (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 63.3.) <hi>Thy loving kindeneſſe is better then life;</hi> Now, I ſay, as the love of God is better to us then the beſt things in the world, ſo the diſpleaſure of God is worſer to us then the worſt things that are in the world; all the torments and racks, all the ſickneſſes and diſtempers, all the reproaches and contempts of men have not ſo much evil in them to us, as one frown from God. Hence, as when two ſore diſeaſes (ſuppoſe the gout and the ſtone) both
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:51057:220"/> very painfull, yet one much exceeding, at once afflict the body, the patient forgets the leſſe: ſo it is, when inward and outward ſorrows at once ceaze upon one man, when the arrows of God are faſtned in his ſpirit, he forgets the arrow in his fleſh. <hi>The wounds of the ſpirit heal all the wounds of the fleſh;</hi> they make them, as if they were no wounds, or not worth the complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, obſerve, <hi>To be accounted wicked, is a ſore affliction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is an affliction to have an ill name, though we deſerve it not, and to be accounted wicked, though we are not; it is I grant far better to be cenſured, then to be flattered. It is very ill when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers count us, and worſt of all when we account our ſelves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then we are, yet it is no ſmall evil to be accounted worſe then we are, eſpecially to be accounted evil, when we are good. A wound in our honour, is not a wound to be ſleighted. It was no ſmall part of the ſufferings of Chriſt, that he was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with the tranſgreſſours in his death, and called <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> a friend of Publicans and ſinners, while he lived.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, obſerve from this, <hi>Do not condemn me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That condemnation is the adjudging of one to be wicked.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Condemnation ſuppoſeth a man guilty, and leaveth him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a penalty. As <hi>Juſtification</hi> is the adjudging and declaring of a perſon to be righteous, or the accepting of <hi>him</hi> for righteous in another, <hi>who</hi> is not righteous in himſelf; ſo condemnation is the adjudging, pronouncing and declaring of a man to be wicked, who in himſelf is wicked. That's <hi>Jobs</hi> firſt requeſt, I will ſay unto God, <hi>Do not condemn me.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Seeing thou art the God and Father of all, who call upon thee in faith, and fear thy Name; therefore in faith and filiall reverence, I beſeech thee to acquit me of my ſinne: yea, becauſe I know thou haſt acquitted me, therefore deal not with me, as if I were condemned for ſinne. Make it appear that thou art my God, either by removing theſe ſtrokes (which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent me to the world as thy enemy, rather then thy ſonne) or by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the dread and terrour of them, that they may appear as exerciſes of my grace, not as revenges upon, or puniſhments of my ſinne: that while my body is pained with thy rod, my ſoul may rejoyce in thy love, and that, while I am under this croſſe, I may triumph over it. Or if thou art reſolved ſtill to detain me at this rate of ſuffering, then I have another humble ſute,</hi>

His office is to hear the cauſe, and upon full evidence on both ſides to paſſe his ſentence. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks in the ſtile of both, deſiring the Lord not to condemn him as a Judge, and to ſhew him why he contended with him, as a party. Thus the Lord is ſaid in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> to have a <hi>controverſie with the inhabitants of Iſrael</hi> (Hoſ. 4.1.) and it ſeems by another Prophet, that he had continued a long one with them, and therefore promiſed, <hi>I will not contend for ever,</hi> Iſa. 57.16.</p>

As there is much of the Word of God, which a ſincere heart after many praiers and much ſtudy, is not able to give a reaſon of: ſo alſo are there many of his works. The text of both is dark to us, till God make the Comment, and he ſees it beſt ſometimes to make us call and call, wait and wait before he makes it. There was famine in the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> three years, year after year, and yet <hi>David</hi> knew not the cauſe; doubtles he did often examine his own heart, &amp; look into the Kingdom, to ſee what might be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation there, but ſaw nothing till (after three years) he enquired of the Lord, who anſwered, <hi>It is for Saul, and for his bloudy houſe, becauſe he ſlew the Gibeonites</hi> (2 Sam. 21.1.) It is more then proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that <hi>David</hi> had enquired of the Lord before that time.

All wrong, how cloſe and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſoever, is oppreſſion. We have that ſenſe of the word (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.7.) <hi>He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand, he loveth to oppreſſe.</hi> How doth a Merchant oppreſſe? He comes not like a thief or a <hi>Nimrod</hi> with a ſword in his hand, bidding you, Deliver your purſe or your life, commanding you to give up your right, or your liberty; but while in buying and ſelling, in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and dealing, he offers you a fair bargain, or as we ſay, a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worth for your penny, he ſmites you ſecretly, and cuts your throat (as famine doth) without a knife: the balances of deceit are in his hand; Balances are put for all inſtruments, or means of trading, by theſe he deceives: light weights oppreſſe the State, as a heavy weight preſſes the body. The word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports alſo oppreſſion by with-holding what is due, as well as by taking away what we duly hold (<hi>Deut.</hi> 24.14.) <hi>Thou ſhalt not oppreſſe an hired ſervant that is poor and needy;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt not detain or keep back any part of his wages.</p>
                     <p>The word (you ſee) is of a large ſenſe, <hi>Is it good unto thee to oppreſſe?</hi> I know thou wilt not oppreſſe me, either by ſpeaking evil of, or over-cenſuring me; either by open violence, or by ſecret fraud; either by taking from me what I have, or by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining from me, what I ought to have. Thou wilt not oppreſſe either with tongue or hand; either as a robber with thy ſword, or as a merchant with thy balances. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> expoſtulates upon higheſt confidence, both of the juſtice and holineſſe of God; as if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord, I know thou doeſt not love to oppreſſe; no thou art mercifull and full of compaſſion. Whence is it then that thou ſeemeſt to act ſo unlike thy ſelf? Is this thy pity to a poor creature, and thy love to the work of thy hands? Thou uſeſt to rejoyce in the conſolation of thy people, and mercy pleaſeth thee; thou uſeſt to ſend out rivers of goodneſſe for wearied ſouls to bathe in, and ſtreams of comfort for thirſty ſouls to drinke and be refreſhed in. How is it then that a bitter cup is put to my lips continually, and that I am over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in a ſalt ſea, in a ſea of gall and bitterneſſe?</hi>

                     <p>Among men (<hi>Mica.</hi> 7.4.) <hi>The best of them is as a brier, the moſt upright is ſharper then a thorn hedge.</hi> Even they that ſeem moſt gentle and compaſſionate, will yet ſometimes ſcratch like briars, and tear like thorns: but the Lord changeth not, neither do his compaſſions fail. The actings of God appear ſometimes unſutable to his nature, but they are never ſo. When he breaks us to pieces, he delights not in our breakings, nor doth he ever break his own, but with an intent to binde them up again. God is ſo farre from loving to oppreſſe, that one of his moſt eminent works of providence is, to relieve thoſe who are oppreſſed (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 12.4.) <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poor will I ariſe, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And when the Lord ariſes, oppreſſours ſhall fall. <hi>O Lord</hi> (cries <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in his ſickneſſe) <hi>I am oppreſſed, undertake for me</hi> (Iſa. 38.14.)

                     <p>But why is man called, <hi>The work of Gods hands?</hi> Hath God (who is a Spirit) hands or any bodily parts?</p>
                     <p>By an ordinary figure in Scripture, hands and feet, eyes and ears, are aſcribed unto God.

                     <p>Firſt, An immediety in the work, or an immediate work. God made man himſelf without any help.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, An exactneſſe in the work, the work proclaims an accurate authour, <hi>The work of thy hands,</hi> a ſpeciall piece of work, No hand but thine could make ſuch a piece.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It notes the fulneſſe and compleatneſſe of the work, a work conſummate and perfect, having the laſt hand put to it. Man is the work of Gods hands in all and each of theſe ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>Heaven is called <hi>a building of God, an houſe not made with hand,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1.) Man is a building of God, and he is the work of Gods hands, yet God made man without hands, as much as he made heaven without hands. The hand of God implies two things;

                           <item>1. The power of God.</item>
                           <item>2. The wiſdom of God.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>Man is the work of both, <hi>For the inviſible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternall power and God head.</hi> Now, if the beams and beauty of the divine nature be viſible in all that was created, then much more in man, who is the epitome or ſum of all that was created.</p>
                     <pb n="443" facs="tcp:51057:224"/>
                     <p>When <hi>Job</hi> puts the queſtion, <hi>Is it good unto thee to despiſe the work of thy hands?</hi> he alludes to artificers,<note place="margin">Alio argumento injuſtitiam a Deo anſert, quòd artifices ſua opera amare ſoleant. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                        </note> who having made an excellent piece, will not deſtroy or break it in pieces, no, they are very tender of their work, yea, they are apt to boaſt and grow proud of it. The inſtinct of nature teaches us to love, not only that which is our own by naturall production, but that alſo which is our own by artificiall conception or operation. Indeed if a man make a mean, or an unworthy piece, he deſpiſes it; ſuch work diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends the workman, and he will break or burn it, rather then let it be made publike to the publiſhing of his own weakneſſe or unskilfulneſſe. Man was the maſter-piece of the whole viſible Creation. Man was made (not as other creatures) to have a <hi>being</hi> only, but that he might <hi>be in the likeneſſe of God,</hi>

                        <hi>and bear his image.</hi> The Lord needs not be aſhamed of, neither doth he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe any part of his work, much leſſe this, which is the beſt and nobleſt part of his work. Hence obſerve in generall,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Man is the work of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All of man, man throughout, is the work of God.</hi> The fabrique of his body is Gods work. <hi>I am fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, marvellous are thy works, and that my ſoul knoweth right well; my ſubstance was not hid from thee, when I was made in ſecret, &amp;c. In thy book all my members were written, which in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance were faſhioned, when as yet there was none of them</hi> (Pſal. 139.14, 15.) A skilfull architect before he builds, draws a model, or gives a draught of the building in his book, or upon a Table; there he will ſhew you every room and contrivance: in his book are all the parts of the building written, while as yet there are none of them, or before any of them are framed and ſet up. In alluſion to Architects and other Artiſans, <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of God, <hi>In thy book were all my members written;</hi> that is, Thou haſt made me as exactly, as if thou hadſt drawn my ſeverall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and my whole proportion with a pen or penſil in a booke, before thou wouldeſt adventure to form me up. The Lord uſes no book, no pen to decipher his work. He had the perfect Idaea of all things in himſelf from everlaſting, <hi>But He may well be ſaid to work as by patern, whoſe work is the moſt perfect patern.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the body, ſo the ſoul of man is the work of Gods hand too. His power and wiſdom wrought it, and work mightily in it. In regard of bodily ſubſtance, the moſt inferiour creatures claim
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:51057:225"/> kindred of man, and he may be compared to the beaſt that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth. But in regard of the ſoul, man tranſcends them all, and may challenge a neerneſſe, if not an equality with the Angels. The body is to the ſoul, but as a mud wall which impriſons ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious treaſure; at beſt but like a gold ring to a ſparkling diamond. If the more unworthy part of man be a work worthy of God, how much more is his more worthy part? There is yet ſomewhat in man of Gods making, which is better then either of theſe parts, and is indeed <hi>all man. There is ſomewhat in man more excellent then man.</hi> The qualities of a man are ſuperiour to his nature: man by his nature differs only from a beaſt, but ſome men by their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties differ from other men: one man hath better qualities then another, but no man hath a better nature then another. As the ſoul is more excellent then the body, and reaſon then ſenſe, ſo inward gifts are more excellent then the ſoul, and grace then reaſon. Theſe are the beauty, the gildings and engravings of the inner man. The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> are called, the work of Gods hands, not only in reference to creation, but regeneration in Chriſt (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.25.) <hi>Bleſſed be Aegypt my people, and Aſſyria the work of my hands, and Iſrael mine inheritance.</hi> 'Tis a promiſe of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when they who were not a people ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt, and be made the ſpirituall <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the mighty work of God. This alſo is the work which <hi>David</hi> intends, when he invites all lands to ſerve the Lord with gladneſſe, becauſe <hi>it is he that hath made us, and not we our ſelves</hi> (Pſal. 100.3.) Hence the Apoſtle cals all believers <hi>emphatically, The work of God</hi> (Epheſ. 2.10.) <hi>We are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works.</hi> Man is the workmanſhip of God, as he is fitted for natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and civil works, but he is moſt of all the workmanſhip of God, as he is fitted for ſpirituall and holy works. All is the work of God, but this is curious work, workmanſhip indeed.</p>
                     <p>From the whole, take three cautions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Be not proud of what ye are, all's the work of God: How beautifull or comely, how wiſe or holy ſoever ye are, 'tis not of your ſelves. What hath any man either in naturals or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturals, which he hath not received?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Deſpiſe not what others are or have, though they are not ſuch exact pieces, though they have not ſuch excellent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments as your ſelves, yet they are what the hand of God hath wrought them, and they have what the hand of God
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:51057:225"/> hath wrought in them. Be more thankfull if ye are better framed, and have more workmanſhip beſtowed upon you, ſleight not thoſe upon whom God hath beſtowed leſſe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Deſpiſe not what your ſelves are; To doe ſo is a ſin, and a ſinne (in reſpect of the body) very common. Many are aſhamed to be ſeen, as God hath made them, few are aſhamed to be ſeen, what the devil hath made them. Many are troubled at ſmall defects in the outward man: Few are troubled at the greateſt deformities of their inner man; they call for no repairs, for no freſh colours to be laid on there; many buy artificiall beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſupply the defects of naturall, who never had a thought of buying (without money) ſpirituall beauty to ſupply the defects of ſupernaturall. The crookedneſſe and diſtortions, the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and uncomelineſſe of the ſoul are moſt deplorable, yet are they little deplored; we are called every day to mend and cure them, we are told where and how we may have all ſet right, and made fair again, and yet the moſt ſtirre not, or not to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. God will not know any body at the laſt day, unleſſe his ſouls be mended by grace, and ſome do ſo mend their bodies by art, that God will not know their ſouls at that day. Depart from me, I know you not (will be all their entertainment) ye have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded your bodies till ye have mar'd your ſouls. Beſides, <hi>What can the man do that cometh after the King?</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> (Eccleſ. 2.12) The work of the wiſeſt among men, is beyond the correction of an ordinary man. Much more may we ſay, <hi>What can the man doe that cometh after God?</hi> The work of the moſt wiſe God is beyond the correction of the wiſeſt among men. They who thus come after God to mend his work, leſt they ſhould be deſpiſed, will but make themſelves more deſpicable. There is more worth in the very defects of Gods work, then in the perfection of mans. We may uſe means to help many bodily infirmities: but they who are diſcontent with Gods work, are quickly proud of their own, and will one day be aſhamed of their own.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Conſider how <hi>Job</hi> argues, <hi>Is it good that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deſpiſe the work of thy hands?</hi> Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is an argument moving the Lord to much compaſſion, to tell him that we are his work, as we are creatures, and his work especially as we are new creatures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When we are under ſuch afflictions as threaten to ruine us, 'tis ſeaſonable to tell the Lord he made us. <hi>David</hi> ſtrengthens
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:51057:226"/> prayer upon this argument (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.8.) <hi>Forſake not the work of thy own hands;</hi> All men love their own works, many dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: Shall we think God will forſake his? See how the people of God plead with God in greateſt diſtreſſe (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.8.) <hi>But now, O Lord, thou art our Father, we are the clay, and thou our Potter, and we all are the work of thine hand, Be not wroth very ſore, O Lord.</hi> Wilt thou be angry with thy work? Lord, be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the works of wicked men, and deſtroy the work of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; Doe not deſtroy the work of thine own hands, thy people are thy work, Haſt thou not formed them for thy ſelf? They will ſhew forth thy praiſe. That invitation to prayer (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.11.) ſeems to intimate that this plea hath a kinde of command upon God, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the holy One of Iſrael, and his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Ask me of things to come concerning my ſonnes, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me:</hi> while ye come to me under that notion, that theſe are the work of my hands, I cannot deny you; Doe but name this, and it is a law upon me, ye may have any thing of me, or doe any thing with me, while ye ſpeak for the work of mine hands. Hence when the Prophet had put the Jews from that plea, they were a loſt people, and their caſe was deſperate, <hi>This is a people of no underſtanding, therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will ſhew them no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> (Iſa. 27.11.) As if he had ſaid, Ye were wont (I know) to come to God with this motive of mercy, when he afflicted you; Lord, thou didſt make and forme us, therefore have mercy upon us, but this ſhall prevail no more: He that made you, will not have mercy on you; He that formed you will ſhew you no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. There is but one argument ſtronger then this among all the Topicks of prayer, and that never fails, namely, that God hath redeemed us, or that we are his redeemed ones. God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed much coſt upon us in the work of Creation, and therefore under that title he can hardly caſt us off, but he hath beſtowed ſo much coſt upon us in the work of redemption, that he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver caſt us off.</p>
                     <p>Further, The Scripture makes frequent uſe of this argument to repreſſe the pride and preſumption of man, and to ſtop his mouth when he begins to queſtion, and call God to account about any of his dealings, with, why is it thus? Or, why am I thus? Thus the Prophet ſilences the murmurings both of mans heart and tongue (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.9, 10.) <hi>Woe unto him that ſtriveth with his Maker,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:51057:226"/> ſhall the clay ſay to him that faſhioned it, Why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> And when the Apoſtle found unquiet, and bold ſpirits buſied in conteſting with God about his eternall counſels, in chuſing ſome and rejecting others, in ſhewing mercy to ſome and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others, he ſtops them with, <hi>Who art thou, O man, that repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> Remember thou art the clay and he is the Potter. <hi>That we are the work of Gods hand moveth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards us, and repreſſeth our preſumption againſt him.</hi> We muſt not proudly diſpute it out with him, for we are the vvork of his hands, and we may humbly plead with him, not to deſpiſe the work of his hands, or to
<q>Shine upon the counſel of the wicked.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>God is light, and he hath light, but he hath none for wicked men, or for their counſels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To ſhine upon the counſel of the wicked</hi> notes three things.<note place="margin">Impiorum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitia illuſtrare, idem eſt quod juvare, &amp; illo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum caeptis ac conatibus fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, To favour or delight in them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To ſuccour or aſſiſt them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, To make them proſperous and ſucceſſefull.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> praying againſt his enemies, ſaith, <hi>Let their way be dark and ſlippery,</hi> Pſal. 35.6. And when the Lord anſwered <hi>Job</hi> out of the whirlwinde, he queſtions, <hi>Who is this that darkneth counſel by words without knowledge?</hi> (Job 38.2.) As to darken waies, and to darken counſel is to hinder and trouble them: ſo to ſhine upon waies and counſels is to help and favour them. <hi>The Sunne is the candle of the world, and Sunſhine is the comfort of the world.</hi> The Pſalmiſt praies in this language, <hi>Thou that dwelleſt between the Cherubims, ſhine forth;</hi> that is, help and favour us; ſo it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the next verſe, <hi>Before Ephraim, Benjamin and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes, ſtir up thy ſtrength, and come and ſave us</hi> (Pſal. 80.1, 2.) <hi>Thou wilt light my candle</hi> (was <hi>Davids</hi> confidence) <hi>the Lord my God will enlighten my darkneſſe, for by thee I have run thorow a troop, and by my God have I leaped over a wall</hi> (Pſal. 18.28, 29.) that is, I have done great things, and I have overcome the greateſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties through thine aſſiſtance. Will God ſhine thus upon the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the wicked? Or will he help the evil-doer? <hi>Iob</hi> denieth it, and therefore praieth, Shew me why thou contendeſt with me. I know thou beareſt no good will to thoſe who are wilfull in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, nor takeſt thou pleaſure in thoſe, who take pleaſure in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
                     <pb n="448" facs="tcp:51057:227"/>
                     <p>But doth not the Lord give good ſucceſſe to thoſe who are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil? Doth the way of the wicked never proſper? Proſpereth it not ſo far ſometimes, that godly men ſtumble in their way, and are offended?</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, God maketh his Sunne to ſhine upon the evil and the good, but himſelfe never ſhineth upon the evil. <hi>Wicked men receive benefits from God, but they receive no bleſſings from God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a two-fold light. Firſt, The light of Gods providence. Secondly, The light of Gods countenance. The light of Gods countenance never ſhines upon the counſel of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they have only the light of his providence. He never ſhines upon them to favour them, though he often ſhines upon them to proſper them. <hi>A man may have much good ſhewed him, and yet no good will ſhewed him.</hi> The clouds and darkneſſe, which at any time cover the counſels of the righteous, are clearer then all the light which ſhines upon the counſels of the wicked. God varies his diſpenſations often, but he never varies his affections; whatſoever he doth againſt the righteous, he never hates or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes them; and whatſoever he doth for the wicked, he never loves or likes them.</p>
                     <p>But who are the wicked intended in this text upon whoſe counſels God will not ſhine? There are four apprehenſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it: who are wicked all agree, but who theſe wicked are is not agreed. Some refer the word to his friends, I know thou wilt not favour their ſinfull cenſures and raſh judgements concerning me. Surely they ſhall receive little thanks and leſſe reward for theſe diſcourteſies; thou wilt not go forth with them, or give wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to what they have done; thou wilt not confirm or atteſt what they have ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> (I grant) found little comfort from his friends: but I doe not finde that they gave him evil counſel, much leſſe that they took wicked counſel againſt him. The Lord reproved them for the errour of their ſpeech, but he did not reprove them for the wickedneſſe of their perſons. Indeed <hi>Iob</hi> charges them deeply (Chap. 13.7.) <hi>Will you ſpeak wickedly for God?</hi> Yet I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he judged them wicked. A thing in it ſelf wicked may be ſpoken, and yet the ſpeaker not be wicked. Therefore I would not think <hi>Job</hi> aims at his friends, or faſtens ſo deep a charge on them, though they had charged him ſo deep.</p>
                     <pb n="449" facs="tcp:51057:227"/>
                     <p>Secondly, Others conceave <hi>Job</hi> means the devil and his angels, <hi>Wilt thou ſhine upon Satans counſel?</hi> As when <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> (being enformed of that conſpiracy againſt the Jews) enquired, <hi>who is he? and where is he that durſt preſume in his heart to doe ſo? Queen Esther ſaid, the adverſary and enemy is this wicked Haman</hi> (Chap. 7.5, 6.) So might <hi>Job</hi> have anſwered the Lord. My adverſary and enemy is this wicked Satan. He laid the plot and hath ſtirred up all theſe evils againſt me: I know Lord, thou wilt not take Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans part: thou wilt not help him who would be the deſtroyer and murderer, who is the great malignant and projectour againſt thy ſervant.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Others take the <hi>wicked</hi> here, for the <hi>Sabeans</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> who were the inſtruments of Satan, in ſpoiling and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing <hi>Job</hi> of his goods and ſubſtance. That they were wicked, we need not queſtion; yet</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Take it rather in generall, for all or any wicked men, upon whoſe waies God ſeems to ſhine when he gives ſucceſſe to their works of darkneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Wicked men are ſometimes proſpered in their counſels, and walk in pleaſant (though evil) waies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God gives delight to thoſe in whom he hath no delight. And they have many good things from him, who never had one good thought from him. Thouſands are proſpered and hated at the ſame time When <hi>Dionyſius</hi> (in the ſtory) had rob'd an Idol-Temple, and at his return by ſea had a fair gale and pleaſant wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to waft him home with the ſpoils; See (ſaid he) how the heavens ſmile upon us, and how the gods are pleaſed with what we have done. The like concluſions many draw from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of outward proſperity: ſurely the true God is pleaſed with us: but there is a cloud upon this Sunſhine and darkneſſe in all this light.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The Lord hates the counſel of wicked men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is ſo farre from ſhining upon, that he, indeed, darkens their counſels. He caſts darkneſſe upon them, even the darkneſſe of his heavieſt diſpleaſure, when themſelves think, and the world ſaith, all is light about them (<hi>Zech.</hi> 1.15.) <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I am very ſore diſpleaſed with the Heathen that are at eaſe;</hi> They had their pleaſure, but God took no pleaſure in them, <hi>I am very ſore
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:51057:228"/> displeaſed with theſe Heathens that are at eaſe,</hi> that is, I approve not their courſes, yea my wrath is kindled againſt their perſons. The light which ſhines upon wicked men, turns all at laſt into heat; and they have alwaies the heat of Gods anger mixed with their light: a heat not to warm but to conſume and burn them up. As when the Lord ſends the clouds and darkneſſe of outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction upon his own people, he ſends likewiſe the beams of his everlaſting love into their hearts: So he clouds and darkens wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, while his candle ſhineth upon their heads.</p>

                     <p>When <hi>Samuel</hi> was ſent to anoint a King over <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the place of <hi>Saul</hi> (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.7.) the Lord ſaid concerning the firſt-born of <hi>Jeſſe, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his ſtature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have refuſed him;</hi> The reaſon added is this, <hi>For the Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth, for man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.</hi> There we have <hi>Jobs</hi> doctrine of Gods ſeeing, delivered by God himſelf. <hi>Samuel</hi> thought he who made the faireſt ſhew to the eie of man, muſt needs be the man who was faireſt in the eye of God; but the Lord ſeeth what is not ſeen, and often findes moſt reality in the leaſt appearance; he who hath not eyes of fleſh ſees beyond the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeven differences between the eye of fleſh or mans eye, and the eye of God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Mans eye is but a means, or an inſtrument of knowledge: Gods eye is his knowledge. The act and the faculty are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct in God. All in God is act; Neither is God another thing from his act: whatſoever is aſcribed to him, is himſelf. The eye of God is God ſeeing. The knowledge of God is God knowing. The love of God is God loving.</p>
                     <p n="2">2, Man muſt have a two-fold light to ſee by; an inward light, the light of the eye and an outward light, the light in the air: without both he cannot ſee; man doth not ſee (as Naturaliſts ſpeak) by ſending forth a beam or a ray from his eye to the object, but by receaving or taking in a beam or a ray from the object into his eie; The object iſſues it's ſpecies to the eye, which being joyned with the viſive power of the eye, man ſeeth: But God ſeeth in himſelf, of himſelf, and from himſelf, he needs no outward light. Chriſt is deſcribed having a fiery eye, <hi>His eyes were as a flame of fire (Revel.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.18.) Even nature teacheth us that thoſe creatures which have fiery eyes, ſee in the dark, and ſee beſt when it is darkeſt, becauſe they ſee by ſending forth a beam or a flame from their eyes, which at once apprehends the object, and enlightens the paſſage to it. God who commanded light to come
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:51057:229"/> out of darkneſſe for the uſe of man, commands light in darkneſſe for his own. <hi>The darkneſſe hideth not from thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) but the night ſhineth as the day. The darkneſſe and the light are both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to thee. There is no darkneſſe nor ſhadow of death, where any of the workers of iniquity can hide themſelves,</hi> Job 34.22. Thus <hi>God hath not eyes of fleſh; he ſeeth not as man ſeeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Man ſeeth one thing after another: his eye is not able to take in all objects at once; he views now one, and then another, to make his judgement of them. But God ſeeth all things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he beholdeth all at one view; his eye takes and gathers in all objects, and all that is in every object by one act. <hi>The Lord looketh from heaven, and beholdeth all the ſonnes of men; from the place of his habitation he looks upon all the inhabitants of the earth (Pſal.</hi> 33.13, 14.)</p>
                     <p n="4">4. An eye of fleſh ſeeth at a diſtance, and at ſuch a diſtance. Naturaliſts tell us, there muſt be a due diſtance between the eye and the object. If you put the object too neer the eye,<note place="margin">Senſibile poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſuper ſenſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tollet ſenſatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</note> the eye cannot ſee it, <hi>That which is ſenſible put upon the ſenſe, takes away ſenſation.</hi> Again, if the object be very remote, the eye cannot make any diſcovery of it, The eye cannot ſee farre, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern ſo farre as it can ſee. We may ſee a thing, and not know what we ſee. But the eye of the Lord ſeeth and diſcerneth at all diſtances. There are none ſo neer him, but he knows what they are; neerneſſe doth not hinder his ſight; and there are none ſo farre from him, but he can diſcover what they are, remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth not hinder his ſight. And indeed all things are preſent with him, as in time, ſo in place; <hi>God is neareſt,</hi>

Let them be what they will, and where they will, his eye-lids do not only ſee, but try, that is, he hath a diſtinct, and a certain knowledge, or a criticall ſight of the ſtate and condition of every man.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Man ſeeth but the colour and skin, the face and out-ſide of things or perſons, but God ſeeth the in-ſides, and looks into the very bowels of them. He is a <hi>ſearcher and diſcerner of the heart:</hi> He ſeeth the ſpirit as ſoon as the face. Our clothes are not more
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:51057:230"/> open to him then our breſts and boſoms. An Heathen wiſhed for a window there, and if we had windows there, we could not ſee what's there. An eye of fleſh cannot reade the meaning of our ſpirits; but the Lord can look into the heart without a window, yea we are all window to him, and he at every turn looks not only upon us, but into us. It was prophecied of Chriſt, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.3.) <hi>He ſhall not judge after the ſight of his eyes; neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove after the hearing of his ears;</hi> that is, he ſhall not judge as a meer man, but as God; he ſhall not judge according to fair ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, or flying reports, <hi>He ſhall judge with righteouſneſſe, and reprove with equity.</hi> Man (whoſe eyes are of fleſh) ſhould not judge according to appearance, yet becauſe his eyes are of fleſh, he cannot judge of that which doth not appear. But God who calleth thoſe things which are not, as if they were, judgeth of thoſe things which appear not, as if they did appear.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. An eye of fleſh may be deceived. The ſight of man is ſubject to manifold deceptions. Many things put a ſtop to the ſight of the eye. The eye of man is in danger of as many fallacies, as the underſtanding; and the underſtanding is entangled with many fallacies by the eye. But there is no errour in the ſight of God, nor any deception of his eye; you cannot by any art or device, by any policy or hypocriſie, by any maſques or diſguiſes, by any ſimulations or diſſimulations make that appear to him, which is not, or make it appear to him otherwiſe then it is. <hi>The heart of man,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>is deceitfull above all things, and desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, who can know it?</hi> (only the Lord who makes, can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this challenge, ſo he doth in the next words) <hi>I the Lord ſearch the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his waies, and according to the fruit of his doings.</hi> How can that which is deceitfull receive according to its doings, but by knowing all its doings and all it's deceits? As the tongue (the greateſt troubler of the world) no man can tame: ſo the heart (the greateſt impoſtour in the world) no man can diſcover but God, and he can do it eaſily, and doth it continually.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. When it is ſaid, the Lord hath not eyes of fleſh, he ſeeth not as man ſeeth, the meaning is, his knowledge is not imperfect as the knowledge of man is. An eye of fleſh hath bin but a while, and can be but a while, and therefore cannot attain much knowledge, <hi>We are but of yeſterday, and know nothing</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bilaad,</hi> c. 8.) <hi>He that
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:51057:230"/> hath but little experience, muſt needs have more then a little igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> Experience breeds knowledge, and brings to perfection in knowledge. The eye of God is from everlaſting. If he had not (as he hath) all knowledge in and from himſelf, he might have fetcht it in before this time, from what he hath ſeen. And he (having ſeen all things) muſt needs have perfect knowledge, whoſe knowledge had been perfect, though he had never ſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe things.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, As this phraſe, an eye of fleſh, imports thinneſſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and thence imperfection of knowledge, ſo groſſeneſſe of ſpirit, and dimneſſe of underſtanding to attain knowledge. When <hi>Peter</hi> made that gracious confeſſion (<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16.) <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Sonne of the living God.</hi> Chriſt anſwers,<note place="margin">Carò ſignificat aliquia pingue obtuſum craſſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> minime ſubti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Bleſſed art thou Simon Bar-jona, for fleſh and bloud</hi> (that is, <hi>man) hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven,</hi> As if he had ſaid, All men are fleſh and bloud, ſo dull-ſighted and blinde, that they could never have perceived this truth by any ſtudy or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it comes only by gift and revelation.</p>
                     <p>The eye of God is not an eye of fleſh in this ſenſe neither. All ſpirits have much clearneſſe of underſtanding, much ſharpneſſe and quickneſſe of apprehenſion. The devil being a ſpirit,<note place="margin">Daemon.</note> though now a wicked ſpirit, hath one name <hi>from knowledge.</hi> How much more knowing is he, who is <hi>The ſpirit,</hi> the Creatour of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of all fleſh, and the Creatour of thoſe ſpirits which ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fleſh?</p>
                     <p>Further, Sight is put for judgement, and ſeeing for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Judging is an act beyond knowing. Judgement is the reſult of knowledge. So, <hi>Thou doſt not ſee,</hi> is, <hi>Thou doſt not judge as man judgeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Mans judgement is often hindered by his affections.<note place="margin">Num vides mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re hominum, &amp; ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Love makes knowledge as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and light as darkneſſe. Chriſtian charity covers a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſins from private revenge, and harſh cenſures; But hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane charity cover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> a multitude of ſins from publike juſtice, and wholſome admonitions. The former keeps from rigid ſeverity, this endangers to cockering flattery. It is not thus with God, <hi>He ſeeth not as man ſeeth.</hi> They who have the greateſt intereſt, the neareſt relation to God, are ſeen what they are, and ſhall be
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:51057:231"/> judged as they are. God hath (indeed) an infinite largeneſſe of affection to poor ſinners, and the lap of his garment of love covers every day a multitude, yea many multitudes of ſins. But he doth not this, becauſe his love to the perſons offending hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his eye from ſeeing, but becauſe his Son having ſatisfied his juſtice for the perſons offending, he turns away his eye from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſins. God proclaims himſelf at once, <hi>The God pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin, and that will by no means acquit the guilty</hi> (Exod. 34.7.) There is nothing but the Name of his Son, and of his Son ſuffering, which turns his eye from ſin. He will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpy, and puniſh, or eſpy to puniſh all our faults through all other titles and intereſts whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Again, Mans judgment is clouded by wrath and malice. He cannot ſee the innocency of thoſe he hates, or do them juſtice to whom he bears no affection. The want of love hinders an eye of fleſh, as much as the inordinacy or exceſſe of it. But though the Lord be angry and diſpleaſed with man, yet he wrongs no man. <hi>The wrath of man cannot work the righteouſneſſe of God, but the wrath of God works righteouſneſſe to man.</hi> He never gives more then right to thoſe he loves moſt, nor leſſe then right to thoſe he hates moſt. That which we call paſſion in God, is acted with higheſt reaſon, his anger never errs.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Man is much ſwaied in judgment by the power, pomp and ſplendour of men. We are apt to think they have moſt worth in them, who are worth moſt. And that they are good, with whom all's well. Even the Saints are toucht with this infirmity: The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> (chap. 2.2, 3.) beſpeaks them thus, <hi>If there come into your Aſſembly a man with a gold ring in goodly apparel, and there come in a poor man in vile raiment, and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and ſay unto him, Come and ſit here by me in a good place, and ſay to the poor, Stand thou there, or ſit here under my foot-stool, Are ye not partiall in your ſelves, and Judges of evil thoughts?</hi> that is, Are ye not condemned in your ſelves, and convinced in your own conſciences, that you do evil, and ſo that your thoughts have been evil, which moved you to do ſo? Can you chuſe but judge this an evil thought, to think him the beſt man that weareth the beſt clothes, and him a vile perſon that is in vile apparel? Thus men, yea good men may miſ-judge of men. But the Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth, It is not good clothes, but a good heart; it is not a gold ring, but a golden converſation
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:51057:231"/> which he accepts; wickedneſſe is abominable in his eye, though it ſit upon a throne; and holineſſe ſhines in his eye, though it lie upon a dung-hill.

I am even a loathing, not only to others, but to my ſelf, yet I know thou doſt not loath me; Thou haſt not a bad opinion of me, becauſe my condition is thus bad.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Man judgeth the cauſe by the effect, the tree by the fruit, the man by his actions, that's the way of mans judgement, and ſo man ought to judge. We ought to think well of them, who do well; and when the hand is clean, charity bids us ſay the heart is clean too. But <hi>the Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth;</hi> he in judging men tranſcends the rule he gives men to judge by. He judgeth the fruit by the tree, the effect by the cauſe, and the action by the man; he had reſpect to <hi>Abel,</hi> and then to his offering. If the worker pleaſe him not, neither doth his work; as he makes, ſo he ſees the tree good, and then then the fruit good. Till the man mends, his manners never mend in Gods eſteem. When a good tree brings forth evil fruit, or an evil tree good fruit, 'tis accidentall to them both, not naturall.

                     <p>In this alſo <hi>Job</hi> comforts himſelf, that whatſoever fruit he might ſeem to bring forth, yet the Lord judg'd him not (as his friends did) by ſome unſavoury ſpeeches that came from him, but by the ſavourineſſe of that ſpirit which was in him. He knew God judged him by the ſetled temper of his inward man, and the ſoundneſſe of his minde, not by the caſuall diſtemper of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, or the ſound of his tongue. <hi>Job</hi> was a good tree, and <hi>the root of the matter was in him.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi> was aſſured God would not condemn him for his fruit, if ſome of it were bitter and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, while he ſaw his root was good.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Man muſt take time to hear and diſcuſſe every caſe, to finde and beat out the truth of every controverſie, but God judgeth all at an inſtant; the matter is no ſooner before him, but
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:51057:232"/> he knoweth it fully: indeed the matter was ever before him, and ever fully known, he knew it from eternity: <hi>Things are known to him before they are, by whom all things are.</hi> The Lord needeth not to put queſtions or to be informed by confeſſions.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Thy daies are not as the daies of man,</hi> thou haſt had, and haſt time enough to gather knowledge and experience, if thou didſt need ſuch help to make thee more knowing. It was the ancient complaint of that great <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> when he ſaw how much of his art he had to learn, and how little time he had to learn it in, <hi>Art is long, and time is ſhort,</hi> what can I learn in ſuch a ſpan-long life as mine? Hence it is conceived, that though the fathers before the flood (ſome of whoſe lives reached eight or nine Centuries) wanted the help of <hi>Libraries</hi> and <hi>Academies,</hi> which we enjoy; yet, that by the experience of ſo many years, they gathered a great ſtock of knowledge, and proved men of eminent learning. Men whoſe daies are not as the daies of ordinary men, attain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge beyond ordinary men. How then can the Lord want any perfection of the moſt perfect knowledge, who numbereth not only by hundreds and thouſands of years, but by an eternity of years. His knowledge muſt needs be full, concerning the ſtate both of things and perſons, who not only hath <hi>Antiquity of daies,</hi> but is the <hi>Ancient of daies</hi> (Dan. 7.9.) Many men have lived ſo many daies, that they are juſtly called <hi>Ancient,</hi> but no man ever lived or ſhall live ſo long, as to deſerve this title, <hi>Ancient of daies.</hi> God is called the <hi>Ancient of daies,</hi> not only, becauſe he hath been many daies, yea all the daies that ever have been, but becauſe he is <hi>ancienter then daies; He is the daies ancient, for he made the day. His daies cannot be like mans daies, who made five daies ancienter then man.</hi> God hath more then all daies, therfore he hath all knowledg: he hath all experience, therfore he hath neither ignorance, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Upon this ground <hi>Job</hi> argues it out with God, that he muſt needs know all thing, who was before all times; and that he was acquainted with him better then all men, who lived at that day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he lived and was acquainted with what he would be, before man had a day, even from eternity.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Theſe words, <hi>Thy daies are not as mans daies,</hi> may refer to the dealing of God with <hi>Job;</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord, why then doeſt thou make ſuch haste to enquire after me? why doſt thou ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly follow me with afflictions? Why doſt thou keep me upon the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:51057:233"/> rack from day to day, night and day, and wilt give me no reſt? Lord, thou needeſt not fear to looſe time, for thou haſt all time at thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: thou canſt not want opportunity, who haſt eternity. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why man is called upon ſo earneſtly, to redeem the time, is, becauſe he hath ſo little time given him, and no time at all, but what is given him. His daies are ſhort daies and they are but few, and (which ſhould provoke him more to make haſte) he knows not how few; unleſſe he lay hold upon the preſent day, he is not ſure of any day. But Lord, thou art Lord of time, and Maſter not only over thy work, but alſo over thy daies, thou canst allow thy ſelf as many daies as thou pleaſeſt to doe thy work in. Why then doeſt thou deal thus ſeverely with me, as if thou were afraid thou ſhouldeſt over-ſlip thy day; or want a ſeaſon to deal with me in.</hi>

                     <p>There is a difference in the later clauſe of the verſe, for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſaith in the firſt, <hi>Are thy daies as the daies of man?</hi> In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond he ſaith, <hi>Are thy years as mans daies?</hi> The daies of God in the firſt part, are the ſame with the years of God in the ſecond. But man hath not years aſcribed to him in the ſecond. The time of man is ſo ſhort that it is reckoned by the ſhorteſt compleat time, a day. And when <hi>David</hi> computes the longeſt date of mans life, he doth not ſay, <hi>The years of man are threeſcore years and ten; but the daies of our years are threeſcore years and ten</hi> (Pſa. 90.10.)
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:51057:234"/> There is yet another difference in the originall about the word <hi>man.</hi> In the firſt clauſe the Hebrew word for man was <hi>Enoſh,</hi> here it is <hi>Geber,</hi> which ſignifies a ſtrong man, a mighty man, a man of the moſt maſculine ſpirit, and ſtrongeſt body, of the moſt vigorous abilities, and greateſt probabilities to live long. A man of braſſe, and heart of oake, rather then of clay, and duſt of the earth, <hi>Lord, Thy daies are not only not as the daies of Enoſh,</hi> a weak, ſickly man, but, <hi>Thy years are not as the daies of Geber, as the daies of</hi> the mightieſt and healthieſt, of the ſtrongeſt and ſtouteſt among the ſons of men.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve hence more diſtinctly the difference between the daies of God, and the daies of man.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Gods day is the day of eternity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mans daies are but daies of time. God is ſaid, <hi>To inhabit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> (Iſa. 57.15.) that is, he is fixed in eternity, he is without beginning, and without end, yea his daies are without ſucceſſion of daies. All the daies of God are but a day. Not only are a thouſand years to him as one day, but eternity is to him as one day. All that God doth, is ſaid to be done <hi>to day; Thou art my ſonne, to day have I begotten thee</hi> (Pſal. 2.7.) yet he ſpeaks (ſay ſome) of the eternall generation of the Son: or, as it referreth to the reſurrection of Chriſt (ſo the Apoſtle expounds it, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33.) God cals that time, <hi>To day,</hi> though it came a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: all is preſent with God; <hi>Paſt and to come in relation to God, is neither paſt nor to come, all is now or to day.</hi> That was not paſt to God, which never had beginning, the eternall generation of his Son: nor was that to <hi>come</hi> to God which was alwaies before him: The temporall reſurrection of his Son, <hi>To day have I begotten thee,</hi> is the moſt proper ſtile for God.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, Mans daies being paſt cannot be recalled: Gods day is ever within his call, for, that which is paſt is as much preſent to him, as that which is preſent, and that which is to come is as much preſent to him, as that which is. <hi>Mans day was, is, and ſhall be, Gods day alwaies is; his name is, I am; It was, and it will be, are diviſions and fragments, morſels and bits of time, eternity is an It is.</hi>

                     <p>His daies are not as mans daies. <hi>He needs not haſten his work, leſt he ſhould looſe his opportunity, who is poſſeſſed of eternity.</hi> And</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This (by the way) ſheweth us the infinite happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and unconceivable bleſſedneſſe of God; <hi>His daies are not as mans daies;</hi> one of mans daies carrieth away one comfort, and the next a ſecond.

He enjoyeth as much at this preſent, what he ever had, as what he hath at this preſent; and he enjoys as much what ſhall be, as he doth what is preſent; he enjoyeth all at once, becauſe he ſeeth all at once. God hath not one thing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, but all together. Eternity is the longeſt and the ſhorteſt, it is longeſt in duration, and the ſhorteſt in fruition, not that the enjoyment of any thing there is ſhort, but becauſe in the ſhorteſt enjoyment there is all.

                     <p>Thirdly, This ſhews the reaſon why the Lord taketh ſuch lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to do his work; he doth not precipitate or thruſt on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, becauſe he may take what time he will. God hath all time at his command. Men bear ſway and rule over perſons and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, God only ruleth times. Man hath not one day in his power, not only not the day to come, but not the day preſent. <hi>Go to now</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> chap. 4.13, 14.) <hi>ye that ſay to day, or to morrow we will go into ſuch a City, and continue there a year, and buy, and ſell, and get gain, whereas ye know not what ſhall be on the morrow,</hi> Nor indeed doth any man know whether he ſhall be on
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:51057:235"/> the morrow, or on all the day wherein he is. God can boaſt of to morrow, that is, of eternity, or of all time to come. Man cannot boaſt of tomorrow, that is of the next day, no nor of the next time to come of the ſame day. Hence it is that man muſt haſten, leſt he miſſe his ſeaſon. When <hi>David</hi> had <hi>Saul</hi> at an advantage (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5.) they about him adviſe him to make uſe of it, and not to let it ſlip, <hi>Behold the day of which the Lord ſaid unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> having ſuch a day, take hold of it, if you let this go, you may never ſee ſuch another. Time is no part of the dominion of Kings. So likewiſe <hi>Abiſhai</hi> counſels <hi>David</hi> upon the ſame advantage (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.8.) <hi>God hath delivered thy enemy into thine hand this day</hi> (let him go this day, and probably thou ſhalt never have the like day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain) <hi>Now therefore let me ſmite him, I pray thee with the spear, even to the earth at once, and I will not ſmite him the ſecond time.</hi> I can diſpatch him at one time, and poſſibly thou ſhalt not have a ſecond time. In a good work, it is good, yea tis beſt to do our work at once, and not to expect (what we may, or may never have) a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, when we have a time. <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en not your hearts.</hi> He hath much hardnes, but no wiſdom in his heart, who hopes to do that good to morrow, which he reſolvs to neglect untill to morrow. A wiſe man may hope to do that to morrow, which he cannot do to day, but it is higheſt folly to reſolve upon a neglect of any duty this day upon a hope of doing it next day. It is ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, becauſe the devil is come down, having great wrath;</hi> (why ſo angry?) <hi>becauſe he knoweth that his time is but ſhort.</hi> When the devil knows he hath but a little time, he will do as much work as he can, and do it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, he ſees all will ſcape out of his hands elſe. Only the Lord haſtens not, neither needeth he to haſten his work at any time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground, becauſe he hath but a ſhort time. He can take what time he will, and make his day as long, and his daies as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as himſelf pleaſeth for the acting of his counſels, whether to puniſh or to ſhew mercy. And hence it is that he delaieth, till wicked profane ſpirits wonder, yea ſcoff at his delay, and think, ſurely the Lord will never do any ſuch thing as he hath threatned, or promiſed, becauſe he ſtaieth ſo long before he doth it; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed to him <hi>that inhabiteth eternity,</hi> deferment is no delay, though to us it ſeem ſo, whoſe times are meaſured out by inches and hours, by moments, and by minutes. Thoſe profane wretches (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.19.) call the Lord, and provoke him to action, <hi>Let him
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:51057:235"/> make ſpeed and haſten his work, that we may ſee it.</hi> The Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſlow and ſlack to many men, but <hi>the Lord is not ſlack as ſome men count ſlackneſſe</hi> (2 Pet. 3.9.) Men think he is ſlack, when he is only patient, and themſelves ignorant, <hi>That a thouſand years to the Lord are but as one day;</hi> God doth not meaſure time by our pole, nor caſt it up by our Arithmetike. Eternity doth not only like the unjuſt ſteward, bid us write <hi>fifty for an hundred,</hi> but <hi>one for a thouſand,</hi> and (which bears the diſproportion of divers hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds in every one of that thouſand) one day for a thouſand years. Time is not only a ſmall thing, but nothing unto God, <hi>Mine age</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) is nothing unto thee</hi> (Pſal. 39.5.) <hi>And if all Nations before him are as nothing, if they are counted to him leſſe then nothing</hi> (Iſa. 40.17.) Then not only the age of one man, but the ages of all men added together, are before him as nothing, and are counted to him leſſe then nothing. <hi>Surely he cannot want time to do all things, before whom all times are nothing.</hi> He cannot want time to pour out his judgements, and to empty the vials of his wrath upon wicked men, nor can he want time to fulfill his promiſes, and to make good every word of bleſſing which he hath ſpoken to, or concerning his own people; Wicked men! Doe not ye hope; Godly men! Do not ye fear, God will not doe what he hath ſaid, becauſe he hath not already done it. He hath not loſt his time or ſeaſon, becauſe he hath not accepted that, which ye thought to be the time or ſeaſon. Chriſt warns his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples (<hi>Joh.</hi> 9.4.) to make haſte about their work, for <hi>the night</hi> (namely of death) <hi>cometh wherein no man can work;</hi> while you have the day, do your work, for I know what day yours is, your day will be gone, and the night will come, then you can work no more: But Gods day fears no night, what ever comes he can do his work. The Preacher gives the ſame counſel upon the ſame ground (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.) <hi>Whatſoever thine hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might;</hi> lay hold upon the fore-lock of time, why? <hi>There is no wiſdom or counſel in the grave whither thou goeſt;</hi> When thou dieſt there is an end of all thy working time; doe thy work well for thou canſt not recall a day of thy life to mend thy work in, neither canſt thou work at all in that night of death. The Lords day knows nothing of a grave, nor is his Sunne acquainted with going down, if he ſeem ſlack to his work, or ſlack at his work this day and the next, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he hath another day at his call, and after that another and another, all which are to him but one
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:51057:236"/> day. Therefore he takes or leaves, defers or haſtens, comes or goes at pleaſure. <hi>Are thy daies, O Lord, as mans daies? Are thy years as the daies of men?</hi> I know they are not.</p>
                     <p>But why doth <hi>Job</hi> make ſo many of theſe negative queries?</p>

                     <p>At loweſt, the word ſignifieth a diligent ſearch, or a ſcrutiny with utmoſt induſtry; even ſuch as they uſe, who maliciouſly hunt for the precious life.

                     <p>The Hebrew is rendered word for word, thus, <hi>It is upon thy knowledge,</hi> or, <hi>It is upon thy know that I am not wicked:</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt not this knowledge from without, thou doſt not ground thy judgement concerning the ſtate of any man upon what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay of him, upon reports or hear-ſaies; no, thy knowledge is from thy ſelf; Thou knoweſt upon thine own knowledge, thine is an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, an immediate, and ſo a perfect, an infallible knowledge, and that tels thee of me, I am not wicked.</hi>

                     <p>He doth not ſay, Thou knoweſt that I am not a ſinner, or, Thou knoweſt that I have not ſinned, <hi>Job</hi> had no ſuch opinion of himſelf, and he knew God had no ſuch knowledge of him. There is a great difference between being a ſinner, and a wicked man. The beſt of Saints while they are here upon the earth are ſinners, but the worſt of Saints even here upon the earth are not wicked; they have a new nature, they are new creatures, regenerate and
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:51057:238"/> born again by the Word and Spirit, therefore they are not wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; though much ſin be in them, yet no wickedneſſe is in them; and they are denominated from their better part, not wicked from their remaining corruption, but holy from their received re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The foundation of God ſtands ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth them that are his</hi> (2 Tim. 2.19.) and he knoweth them that are not his: not his by the grace of election and regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for all are his by the right of creation and dominion. Thus he knows all the fowls of the mountains, and the beaſts of the field are his (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.11.) <hi>David</hi> gives this glory to God in his own caſe (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.1.) <hi>O Lord, Thou haſt ſearched me and known me;</hi> God did not ſearch him to know him, but he ſearched him
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:51057:239"/> and knew him. The knowledge of God was not a conſequent, but a concomitant of that ſearch; or it is ſpoken in oppoſition to man; a man may ſearch his neighbour, and yet not know him. There are depths and turnings in the heart of man, which no man can reach or finde out; but God hath a threed which will lead him into all and thorow all the labirynths, a line which will found all the depths of man. Hence <hi>David</hi> makes a particular of the knowledge of God; God knew him in all that he was, and in all that he did, <hi>Thou knoweſt my down-lying and my up-ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and thou art acquainted with all my waies.</hi> God is the Judge of all men, therefore he knows all men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>There is no creature which is not manifeſt in his ſight,</hi>

                        <hi>all things are naked and open before him, with whom we have to doe.</hi> The Apoſtle by two meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors in theſe words teaches us, that as the out-members and lineaments of the body, together with their beauty or deformity are clearly ſeen, when the body is naked and uncloathed; that as the bowels and intrals of the body, together with their ſoundneſſe or diſeaſes are perfectly diſcovered, when the body is diſſected or cut up by the hand of a skilfull anatomiſt, even ſo are we in all we do, and in all we are perfectly known, or as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.) <hi>manifeſt unto God,</hi> even manifeſt with as much clearneſſe to the knowledge of God, as the light is to the eye of man. He knows, 1. Our perſons. 2. Our actions. 3. He knoweth the manner of our actions. 4. He knoweth with what hearts we act. 5. He knoweth not only the means we uſe, but the ends we propoſe in every action. 6. He knoweth what we have been as well as what we are. And 7. He knoweth what we will be, as well as what we are or have been; He knoweth what we have done, as well as what we do, and he knoweth what we will do, as well as what we do or have already done. He ſeeth all creatures in the glaſſe of his own counſels thorow and thorow. His eye hath thorow lights in all parts of the world, and in the hearts of all men in the world.</p>
                     <p>And ſeeing man cannot be hid from God, it is the vaineſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for any man to think of hiding himſelf from God; yet that's not only the attempt, but the hope of many, who while they do what they would not have ſeen, pleaſe themſelves with this conceit, that they are not ſeen in doing it, or that they can ſecure what they have done from being ſeen. We learn'd this of our firſt parents, in whom the firſt thing that appeared (next
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:51057:239"/> their ſhame) after they had ſinned, was the hiding of their ſinne. Man loveth to draw a curtain between God and himſelf, to raiſe up artificiall darkneſſe, and to walk in thick clouds (as he vainly hopes) undiſcovered.</p>
                     <p>Again, Doth God know us? then let us labour to know our ſelves. God knows who are wicked, many are wicked and know it not. It is a wofull miſtake, when we think our ſelves to be in a good eſtate, and God knows us to be in a bad eſtate! It is a wrong to God and our ſelves, when God knows us to be in a good eſtate, and we think our ſelves to be in a bad eſtate; but it is farre worſe, when we think our eſtate good, and God knows it to be bad. We ſhould be acquainted with our condition, leſt we (like <hi>Laodicea</hi>) flatter our ſelves into an opinion that we are rich and clothed, and have need of nothing, when God knows we are poor and naked, and wanting all things.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve from the elegancy of the Hebrew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. <hi>It is upon thy knowledge that I am not wicked.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God knoweth all things in and of himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This gives glory to God, and lifteth him up above the creature in the fulneſſe of his knowledge. Men who have the greateſt knowledge, and vaſteſt comprehenſions of things, yet have not that knowledge in and from themſelves, they fetch it in by bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed helps, and glad they can have it ſo too. It coſts man a great deal of travell and ſtudy, to make himſelf maſter of a little knowledge (<hi>Job</hi> 12.12.) <hi>With the ancient is wiſdom, and in length of daies is underſtanding:</hi> Some indeed get wiſdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and are owners of a vaſt ſtock and treaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but when? but how? When they are old; when they have had long experience, and have ſtudied hard for it, <hi>With the ancient is wiſdom, and in length of daies is underſtanding:</hi> Thus men get knowledge. But mark what is ſaid of God in the next words (<hi>verſ.</hi> 13.) <hi>But with him</hi> (meaning God) <hi>is wiſdom and ſtrength, He hath counſel and underſtanding. With him it is, and he hath it:</hi> The Lord doth not grow more knowing by years, nor doth his underſtanding mend by the multitude of daies: though he be the <hi>Ancient of daies,</hi> yet it is not his antiquity which hath got him this knowledge; his knowledge is in him, and with him, and from himſelf; he fetches not his knowledge from ſence, nor doth he take it up by information; He learns it not by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration raiſed from the things themſelves, nor by the collation of
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:51057:240"/> one thing with another. He doth not know this to be ſo, becauſe that is ſo, but all things are ſo, becauſe he knows them. He knows all, 1. Fully, not to halves. 2. Certainly, not probably. 3. Actually, not poſſibly. 4. At once, not ſucceſſively; as not one thing by another, ſo not one thing after another. Such are the eminencies and tranſcendencies of the knowledge of God.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture ſpeaks ſometimes as if God derived his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from report, or as if he did not know whether a people were vvicked or no, till he had enquired. When the new world vvas building their <hi>Babel,</hi> the Lord ſaid, <hi>Let us go down to ſee the City</hi> (Gen. 11.5.) And when <hi>Sodom</hi> was burning in luſt, the Lord reſolved, <hi>I will go down and ſee whether they have done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together according to the cry of it, which is come unto me, and if not, I will know</hi> (Gen. 18.21.)</p>
                     <p>In both thoſe places of Scripture God comes down to our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, but he comes not down to any place in the vvorld. He needs not come any vvhether, who is every vvhere. God ſpeaks after the manner of men: but he acts not after the manner of men. God gives us an example what we ſhould do, he doth not work after our example. Leſt we ſhould judge before we ſee, God ſaith, I vvill go down and ſee, before I judge: leſt we ſhould cenſure one another upon fames and common cries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further enquiry, whether it be ſo or no, therefore the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will go down and ſee whether they have done altogether accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cry that is come unto me.</hi> God knew <hi>Sodom</hi> vvas vvicked, before he came down, but he came down to make it known, that he knew it.</p>
                     <p>As thoſe Scriptures ſeem to import that God knew not how vvicked the builders of <hi>Babel</hi> were, or the dwellers in <hi>Sodome,</hi> till he took pains to enquire; ſo another Scripture imports, that he did not know <hi>Abraham</hi> vvas a godly man, till he made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment of it, by putting him upon that hard piece of obedience, the offering up of his ſon, <hi>Now I know thou feareſt me</hi> (Gen. 22.12.) as if the Lord had collected his knowledge of vvhat <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> vvas, from vvhat <hi>Abraham</hi> did. But that teſtimony of God, <hi>Now I know,</hi> is but now I have made it known, or, now I know that in the fruit, vvhich I knew before in the root; now I ſee my fear in thy works, as before I ſaw it in thy faith. That place (<hi>Deut.</hi> 8.2.) bears a like ſenſe; where <hi>Moſes</hi> beſpeaks <hi>Iſrael</hi> thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee theſe
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:51057:240"/> fourty years in the wilderneſſe, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldeſt keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments or no.</hi> The Lord needed not fourty years, no nor one minutes experience to make up his thoughts concerning that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; he knew vvhat they vvere at firſt ſight, and vvhat they vvould prove (even a ſtubborn, an unbelieving and a back-ſliding peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) before they vvere. God proved them, not to know vvhat vvas in their hearts, but that we might know it: that, vvhat he knew by his internall, immediate inſpection, others alſo might know by externall obſervation. It vvould not have been believed, that they vvere ſo bad, if God had not drawn it out by that fourty years variety of his diſpenſations towards them. Or <hi>Moſes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes God after the manner of men, vvho prove things that they may know them, vvhereas indeed God knows, and then proves them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Conſidering how <hi>Job</hi> comes in vvith this aſſurance <hi>[Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked]</hi> to relieve himſelf in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, vve may obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That it is matter of higheſt conſolation to the Saints, to know and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that God knows them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That God knows their hearts and lives, is the joy of their hearts and lives. How rejoycingly doth <hi>David</hi> ſpeak (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.1, 2.) <hi>O Lord, thou haſt ſearched me and known me, thou knoweſt my down-ſitting and mine up-riſing,</hi> &amp;c. He ſeems to be as glad that God knew him, as that God vvould ſave him. <hi>My witneſſe is in heaven, and my record is on high,</hi> vvas <hi>Iobs</hi> reſort again, vvhen his friends ſcorned him (<hi>chap.</hi> 16.19.) There are no miſtakes in God; he vvill give right evidence, as a vvitnes, and a righteous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as a Judge.</p>
                     <p>Again, That God knows us, aſſures us,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That vvhat vve have done ſhall not be forgotten; <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget our work and labour of love,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. It aſſures us,</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That vve ſhall not be miſ-interpreted for vvhat vve have done. The reaſon vvhy many men have ſo ill an opinion of others, is, becauſe they have ſo little knowledge of them. Ignorance makes as corrupt gloſſes, as unſound deciſions upon perſons and actions, as it doth upon texts or queſtions. Some pervert know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and againſt light, but moſt pervert ignorantly and for vvant of light. God knows us perfectly, and he never acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:51057:241"/> his knowledge. It aſſures us,</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That vve ſhall be well accepted and rewarded. Though men make ill requitals, and pay in bad, yea in baſe coyn, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ſhall receive of God according to vvhat he is, and vvhat his vvorks are (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7.) <hi>If thou doſt well, Shalt thou not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, It is a comfort to us, vvhile vve are uncertain about our own eſtates, to know that God knoweth <hi>us.</hi> God hath a better opinion of ſome men then they have of themſelves. Some do not only think, but judge and conclude themſelves vvicked, vvhen God knoweth that they are not vvicked. <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth who are his.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked.</hi> Then obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To do wickedly, or to be wicked is inconſiſtent with grace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If <hi>Job</hi> had been a vvicked man, he had been a loſt man. Sin is not inconſiſtent vvith grace, but vvickednes is.</p>
                     <p>But you vvill ſay, What is vvickedneſſe? And vvhen is a man ſo ſinfull that he is to be numbred among the vvicked? To clear that, becauſe <hi>Job</hi> ventures all upon it,</p>
                     <p>I anſwer; firſt, In every vvicked man ſin reigneth, that is, ſin hath not only a being in him, but dominion over him; he yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ready and free obedience to it, as to his <hi>naturall Lord,</hi> not a forced and involuntary obedience only, as to a <hi>tyrant.</hi> Our commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ſin gives not the rule to ſinne: but our ſubmitting to it. As a man may do many good things, and yet grace not raign and rule in his heart: ſo it is poſſible for a man to do many evil things, and yet not have ſin rule in his heart. A man may lay by the actings of a ſin, and yet that be a raigning ſinne, and a man may fall into the act of ſin, and yet that no raigning ſin. The raign of ſin or of grace are chiefly ſeen in that profeſſed ſubjection or reſignation of our ſelves to the dictates and commands of grace or ſinne. <hi>No man can be at once Gods Son, and ſins ſervant; no nor at once a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to both.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, A vvicked man is a cuſtomary ſinner, he driveth a trade in ſinne. A godly man (poſſibly) may commit the ſame ſinne again, yet the cuſtom is broken, becauſe he putteth in a plea againſt ſinne, and often moveth God for power, not only againſt, but over it: if he attain not this bleſſed victory, yet he ceaſeth not to complain, and pray, <hi>O wretched man that I am,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:51057:241"/> who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> When ſhall I be delivered from this burden and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>dage of corruption? When ſhall it once be? O that it might once be! Wicked men are ſo far from pleading againſt, that they uſually plead for their ſins; and labour more to make excuſes and apologies for them, then to get power and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over them. They in ſtead of making preparation to reſiſt the luſts of the fleſh, make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill the luſts thereof.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, A vvicked man preſerves in himſelf a purpoſe to ſinne, vvhile he ſeems to pray and proteſt againſt his ſinne. He is (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> confeſſed of himſelf before his converſion) afraid God ſhould grant his praier, vvhile he praieth that his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be mortified. He may put up praiers againſt ſin, but he puts up no deſires againſt it. As cuſtom is the rode of our lives, ſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes are the rode of our hearts. What a mans purpoſes are, ſuch the movings of his heart are (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.12.) <hi>To morrow ſhall be as to day, and much more abundant,</hi> ſay they in their beaſtly abuſe of the creatures, we have been drunk to day, and hope to be more to morrow (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.21.) <hi>Their heart doth go after the heart of their abominable things;</hi> that is, the inclinations and reſolutions of their hearts go or walk after their abominations. A godly man ſinneth, but he doth not purpoſe to ſinne; his purpoſes are not to ſinne, holineſſe is his way; and as ſinne is it ſelf a by-way, ſo it is beſides his way. The honeſt traveller intends to keep ſtraight on to his journeys end, if he miſſe his vvay at any time, he miſſes his purpoſe. The robber skulks about in by-vvaies, and comes not into the rode, but to finde and ſeize upon his prey. <hi>Peter</hi> denied Chriſt, but did <hi>Peter</hi> purpoſe to deny Chriſt? No, <hi>Peter</hi> purpoſed not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt, yea <hi>Peter</hi> promiſed not to deny Chriſt. <hi>Peter</hi> reſolved that he would die rather then deny Chriſt, &amp; yet he denied Chriſt; <hi>Peter</hi> did not go out and make a bargain vvith the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, as <hi>Judas</hi> did to betray his Maſter. <hi>Peter was betraied when he denied his Maſter, Peter</hi> was ſuddenly attached with a violent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation &amp; arreſted vvith baſe fear. He did not deny Chriſt, becauſe he reſolved to do it, but becauſe he reſolved ſo much not to do it, vvithout due dependance upon Chriſt for power not to do it. A godly man may have ſome deliberations about ſin, yet no reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: He may deliberate upon the acting of ſome ſin, vvhen the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is given, but he doth not deliberate upon the finding of occaſions to provoke him to the acting of ſinne. <hi>David</hi> did not
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:51057:242"/> go up to his houſe top to invite an incentive of luſt, though he there met with one.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Wickedneſſe carrieth clearneſſe, yea fulneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in ſinne. A wicked man may have many checks at ſinne from his conſcience, but he hath none from his will. And a wicked man may have ſome motions to good from his conſcience, but he hath none from his will. When a wicked man abſtains from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, he wils it; and when he doth good, he wils it not. In nature, the act and the conſent go both to evil, <hi>I doe evil, and I will do it, is the ſtubborn voice of corrupt nature.</hi> In grace, though the act goes ſometimes to evil, yet the conſent doth not. <hi>The evil which I would not, that do I, is the mournfull voice of grace.</hi> In glory, both act and conſent go to good, and neither of them to any evil. <hi>The good which I will, I doe, the evil which I would not, I do not, ſhall be for ever the triumphant voice of glory.</hi> When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (Rom. 7.) bewailed his own bondage under cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, he yet profeſſed that what ever evil he did, he conſented not to do it. And though there may be ſome kinde of conſent in the ſinning of a godly man, yet it is not ſuch a conſent, as in a wicked man: For as a wicked man, though he may ſometimes ſhew his willingneſſe, and give his conſent to do good, to hear the Word, to pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet it is not a clear, a full and free conſent, the will never comes up heartily in it: ſo there may be ſome kinde of conſent, a negative conſent in a godly man doing evil, he may not (as to that act) reſiſt or deny; as when a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is put to the vote, a man who doth not affirm, may be ſaid to give ſome conſent, when he ſuſpends his voice, and doth not openly oppoſe. Thus a godly man when a temptation cometh, never gives a direct <hi>yea</hi> of conſent, yet ſometimes not giving his <hi>no,</hi> there is a kinde of conſent, a middle act, not a clear or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate act of conſent. Now a wicked man, as he is <hi>taken ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive by the devil at his will</hi> (2 Tim. 2.26.) that is at Satans will, the devil takes him captive when he pleaſeth: ſo alſo at his own will; He is pleaſed to be taken captive by the devil.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Eram gratis malus &amp; mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae meae cauſa nulla erat, niſi malitia <hi>Auguſt.</hi> lib. <hi>3.</hi> confeſſ. c. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note>Fifthly, Where there is a wickedneſſe in ſinning, there is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſin. Pure delight in ſin is impureſt wickedneſſe. To diſobey for nought is the moſt wicked diſobedience, as to ſerve God for nought is the moſt holy ſervice. What is it which ſheweth the eminency of grace? Is it not the joy which the ſoul findes in the waies of grace? When we can delight in the law of God, as his
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:51057:242" rendition="simple:additions"/> law, abſtracted from ends and fruits. When it is meat and drink to us to do the will of God, though we ſuffer hunger, and are ready to ſtarve in doing it, here is godlineſſe at the higheſt: and when any delight in ſinne as ſinne, as contrary to the will of God, abſtracted from ends and fruits, here is wickedneſſe at the higheſt. To act in ſuch a degree of ſin, is inconſiſtent with any degree of grace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> appeals to the teſtimony of God, that he had not ſinned in any of theſe degrees, while he ſaith, <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Obſerve, Fifthly, <hi>A godly man may know that he is ſo, and be confident of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that ſaith, God knoweth he is not wicked, knoweth it himſelf. For though the Lord hath a knowledge of us beyond ours, though he know us, better then we know our ſelves, yet no man can tell the Lord, <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked,</hi> but he who knows that he is not. The excellency of our condition conſiſts in being godly, the comfort of it conſiſts in knowing that we are godly. When <hi>David</hi> offers himſelf to the triall (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.24.) <hi>Search me, O Lord, and ſee if there be any way of wickedneſſe in me;</hi> He ſpeaks not as doubting whether he were wicked or no, but as being aſſured that he was not. As if he had ſaid, There are many weakneſſes in me I know, but I know not of any wickedneſſe. He that offers himſelf to Gods ſearch for his wickedneſſe, gives a ſtrong argument of his own up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe. The beſt of the Saints may be at a loſſe ſometimes for their aſſurances, and not know they are good. They may ſtand ſometimes hovering between heaven and earth, yea between heaven and hell, as uncertain to which they ſhall be accounted. Yet many of the Saints are fully perſwaded they are Saints, and ſit with Chriſt in heavenly places, while they are w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ndering here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the earth. A godly man may know this two vvaies;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By the vvorkings of grace in his heart.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By the teſtimony of the Spirit with his heart.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By the vvorkings of grace in his heart (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.3.) <hi>Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments:</hi> and (<hi>chap.</hi> 3.14.) <hi>We know that we are paſſed from death to life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we love the brethren.</hi> There may be ſuch workings of grace in the heart, as may amount to an evidence of grace. <hi>What our being is, is diſcernable in our workings.</hi> The word is, as clear as
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:51057:243"/> light, that our juſtification may have a light or evidence in our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, though no cauſe or foundation there. Grace is the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Chriſt ſtamped upon the ſoul, and they who reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſouls, ſee the image of Chriſt there, may be ſure that Chriſt is theirs. Chriſt hath given all himſelf to thoſe to whom he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this part of himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This may be known by the teſtimony of the Spirit with the heart (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5.) <hi>He that hath wrought us for the ſelf ſame thing is God;</hi> God ſets up a frame of holineſſe in every believer, He hath wrought us; and how are we aſſured that he hath? <hi>Who alſo hath given us the earneſt of his Spirit.</hi> The graces of the Spirit are a reall earneſt of the Spirit, yet they are not alwaies an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall earneſt; therefore an earneſt is often ſuperadded to our graces. There is a three-fold work of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To conveigh and plant grace in the ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To act and help us to exerciſe the graces, which are planted there.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, To ſhine upon and enlighten thoſe graces, or to give an earneſt of thoſe graces; This laſt work the Spirit fullfils two waies.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, By arguments and inferences, which is a mediate work.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, By preſence and influence, which is an immediate work. This the Apoſtle cals <hi>witneſſe-bearing</hi> (1 Joh. 5.8.) <hi>There are three that bear witneſſe in earth, The Spirit, and the water, and the bloud.</hi> The Spirit brings in the witneſſe of the water and of the bloud, which is his mediate work; but beſides and above theſe he gives a diſtinct witneſſe of his own, which is his immediate work, and is in a way of peculiarity and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency, called the witneſſe of the Spirit. Hence that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, We have not received the spirit of the world, but we have received the Spirit which is of Chriſt, that we may know the things that are freely given us of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.12. The things freely given may be received by us, and yet the receit of them not known to us, therefore we receive the Spirit, that we may know what is given us, and what we have received. The Spirit doth (as it were) put his hand to our receits, and his ſeal alſo, whence he is ſaid, <hi>To ſeal us up to the day of redemption,</hi> Epheſ. 4.30.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A godly man dares appeal to God himſelf, that he is not wicked.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He dares ſtand before God to juſtifie his ſincerity, though he
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:51057:243"/> dares not ſtand to juſtifie himſelf before God. <hi>Job</hi> had often laid all thoughts of his own righteouſneſſe in the duſt, but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſtands up for his own uprightneſſe. <hi>God is my witneſſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom, 9.1.) <hi>whom I ſerve in my ſpirit in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of his Sonne;</hi> I ſerve God in my ſpirit, and God knows that I do ſo, I dare appeal unto him that it is ſo, <hi>God is my witneſſe.</hi> When Chriſt put that queſtion, and drove it home upon <hi>Peter</hi> thrice, <hi>Simon, Lovest thou me? Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Thou knoweſt all things, Thou knoweſt that I love thee</hi> (Joh. 21.) As if he had ſaid, I will not give teſtimony of my ſelf, thou ſhalt not have it upon my word, but upon thine own knowledge. It were eaſie for me to ſay, <hi>Maſter, I love thee with all my heart, with all my ſoul,</hi> but I refer my ſelf to thy own boſome, <hi>Thou knoweſt I love thee.</hi> So when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> lay (as he thought) upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, he turned himſelf to the wall, deſiring God to look upon the integrity of his life, <hi>Lord, remember how I have walked before thee in truth</hi> (Iſa. 38.3.) I do not go to the world for their good word of me, I reſt not in what my Subjects or neighbour Princes ſay of me, Lord, it is enough for me, that what I have been, and what I am, is laid up ſafe in the treaſury of thy thoughts. This brings ſtrong conſolation, when we take not up the teſtimony of men, nor reſt in the good opinion of our brethren, but can have God himſelf to make <hi>affidavit,</hi> or bear witneſſe with us, and for us. That ſuch a man will ſay, I am an honeſt man, that ſuch a man will give his word for me, is cold comfort; but when the ſoul can ſay, God will give his word for me, <hi>The Lord knows that I am not wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;</hi> here's enough to warm our hearts when the love of the world is waxen ſo cold, and their tongues ſo frozen with unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe, that they will not ſpeak a good word of us, how much good ſoever they know by us.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Conſider the condition wherein <hi>Job</hi> was, when he ſpake this, he was upon the rack, and, as it were, under an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, God laid his hand extream hard upon him, yet at that time, even then, he ſaith, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt that I am not wicked.</hi> Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A man of an upright heart and good conſcience, will not be brought to think that God hath ill thoughts of him, how much evil ſo ever God brings upon him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The actings of God toward us are often full of changes and turnings, but the thoughts of God never change. A ſoul may be
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:51057:244"/> afflicted till he is weary of himſelf, yet he knows God is not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of him. Whomſoever he hath once made good, he cannot but for ever eſteem good; and, all ſuch a mans afflictions, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſhew how good God hath made him, or to make him better.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, <hi>Job</hi> was under as bad thoughts of man, as (almoſt) any man ever was, when he ſpake thus to God, <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked.</hi> Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That all the hard cenſures and miſconſtructions of men, cannot beat an upright heart out of this hold, that God loveth him, and hath a good opinion of him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let men think what they will of him, and judge him as ſeverely as they pleaſe; this moves him not at all to think, that God judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es him ſo too. He can ſee the love of God thorow all the anger of creatures. He likes not his condition the better, becauſe ſome men tell him it is good, nor the worſe, becauſe any man tels him it is ill, while he findes himſelf bottomed upon the free grace of God, and cheared with the clearneſſe of his own integrity. <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not</hi> (much leſſe ſhall the uncharitableneſſe of men) <hi>prevail againſt ſuch a man.</hi> Happy is he, who can ſay unto God, <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked,</hi> while men are ſaying, thou art wicked. And how miſerable is he, whoſe heart tels him he is wicked, though men ſay, ſurely, thou art good. <hi>If our heart condemn us, God is greater then our heart, and knoweth all things,</hi> (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20.) Doth conſcience tell you that you are wicked, God can tell you ſo much more? It is a wofull thing for any man to be under the juſt condemnation of his own heart, though it is more wofull to be under the flatteries of his own heart. <hi>It is bad enough to be daubed by others with untempered morter, it is far worſe to be a ſelf-dauber;</hi> No man hath cauſe to rejoyce in what himſelf, or be troubled at what others ſay of him, unleſſe God ſay ſo too.</p>
                     <p>Two things are further obſervable from theſe words;</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>There is no medium between a godly and a wicked man.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is one of theſe two. Some are called civil honeſt men; many conceit that theſe are good men indeed, and not a few, that theſe are in a middle ſtate between good and evil: But the truth is, there is nothing between good and evil, light and darkneſſe: there is no <hi>medium</hi> of participation between theſe extrems. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> (Eccleſ. 9.2.) ſets all men in two orders, <hi>All things come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like unto ell, there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked, to the
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:51057:244"/> good, to the clean, and to the unclean, to him that ſweareth, and to him that feareth an oath.</hi> Note by the way, he doth not put the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between him that ſweareth, and him that ſweareth not, but between him <hi>that ſweareth, and him that feareth an oath.</hi> There are many who are not ſwearers (ſwearing is deboyſery, and ſo inconſiſtent with civility) who yet do not fear an oath. It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to fear to do evil, then not to do evil. This diviſion runs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the whole world. Good and evil (in a remiſſe degree) min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in the ſame perſon, but no mans perſon is in a middle ſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and evil.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>God hath a negative knowledge concerning the ſtate of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man.</hi> This is a tranſcendent, beyond any knowledge which man hath of man. God doth not only know what is in us, but what is not in us, not only what we are, but what we are not. <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked.</hi> The reaſon why a negative oath is not admitted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, is, becauſe no man can ſwear ſo in knowledg. None can ſpeak negatively of another, knowingly, but God alone. We may ſay of a man, there is that in him for which it is meet for us to judge him godly. But it is impoſſible from any outward evidence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude peremptorily, he is not wicked. It is more to ſay of a man, he is not wicked, then to ſay, he is godly. <hi>It is eaſier to know what is, then what is not.</hi> As it is in voting, ſo in knowing: Negative votes are ſtrongeſt. To ſay ſuch a thing ſhall not paſſe or be done, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the greateſt power: ſo negative knowledge is the higheſt, to ſay ſuch a thing is not, or ſuch a man did it not, imports a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge, a knowledge ſo certain, as is appliable to none, but God himſelf, <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked.</hi>

                        <hi>The hand of God</hi> is the power of God; and to deliver out of his hand, is to fetch out, or free from his power. The word which we tranſlate to deliver, notes delivering either by power or by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, by ſtrength, or by wit. A priſoner is delivered ſometimes by reſcue or open violence, ſometimes by ſtealth or ſecret convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; he picks a lock, or breaks a door to deliver himſelf out of the hand of man. But neither of theſe waies can any man deliver
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:51057:245"/> himſelf, or get deliverance out of the hand of God. There is no difficulty in the interpretation of theſe words, but there is ſome difference about the intent of them.</p>

                        </note>Firſt, Some, for <hi>none,</hi> tranſlate <hi>nothing,</hi> and ſo joyn theſe words with the former, as an argument of the inſufficiency of mans righteouſneſſe, <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked,</hi> yet there is <hi>nothing</hi> (in my righteouſneſſe) <hi>that can deliver me out of thine hand.</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.) <hi>I know nothing by my ſelf, yet am I not hereby juſtified.</hi> So <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, Lord, Thou knoweſt nothing by me, yet hereby I cannot be delivered.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Theſe words may be expounded, as tending to move compaſſion, and to ſtir up bowels of pity in God toward <hi>Job;</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord, why doſt thou deal thus ſeverely with me, when there is none that can deliver me out of thine hand; who can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue me, while thou laieſt thine arreſt upon me? Thou maiſt keep me under reſtraint, as long as thou wilt; I cannot be fetcht off, or out, and wilt thou deal thus hardly with me? Wilt thou puniſh me thus?</hi> Whom we cannot hold long in our hands, we are apt to deal more roughly with, while they are in our hands, and to take our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worths out of them, while we have them. And 'tis uſuall with great Princes ſpeedily to ſeal the Writ of execution againſt an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent offender, when they hear or ſuſpect many potent ſuters will move for his pardon, and ſolicite his deliverance out of the hand of juſtice. <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to ſpeak in alluſion to ſuch, <hi>If there were any who could deliver me out of thine hand, or pull me away from thee by ſtrength, or by entreaty, I ſhould wonder the leſſe at thy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity.</hi>

As if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord, Thou knoweſt, and thou ſhalt know, that I am not wicked, though none deliver or take me out of thine hand, Thou ſhalt finde me holding mine integrity, as long as I hold my life, I am reſolved to honour thee, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou doeſt with me.</hi> And ſo he refutes the charge of Satan: Satan ſaid, <hi>Touch his fleſh and his bone, and he will curſe thee to thy face:</hi> No, ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> though he taketh away my fleſh and my bones, yet I will not curſe him to his face, no nor ſpeak an ill word of him behinde his back. Though I ſhould never be delivered, yet God ſhall never be blaſphemed. Upon the whole obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That there is no means on earth can reſcue us out of the hand of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I kill, and I make alive, I wound, and I heal; neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.</hi> Deut. 32.39. Till God diſcharge us there's no eſcaping: none can force us out of his hand, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is in theirs; power cannot, policy cannot, riches cannot: we cannot bribe our ſelves out of the ſight, or beyond the ſtroke of divine juſtice. A golden key will not open Gods priſon door. <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es avail not in the day of wrath,</hi> and in ſome daies of wrath, prayer it ſelf cannot prevail. Then take heed how ye fall into the hands of God. No wiſe man will run into his diſpleaſure, from whom there is no deliverance, but at his own pleaſure. See more of this point, Chap. 9.12.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, We have <hi>Jobs</hi> ſtrength of aſſurance, or his aſſertion concerning all this at the 13. verſe, <hi>Theſe things thou haſt hid in thine heart, I know that this is with thee;</hi> as if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord, Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all is truth which I have spoken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three opinions concerning the connection or tie of theſe words with thoſe that went before.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Some conceive that <hi>Job</hi> perſiſteth in the ſame matter hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in the words immediately foregoing, exalting the knowledge of God concerning man upon this ground, becauſe God made man. <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked.</hi> How did <hi>Job</hi> know that? He muſt needs know what man is, who made man, <hi>Thine hands have made me and faſhioned me together round about;</hi> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as I am thy work, a piece of thy framing, ſurely, thou knoweſt what thou haſt framed: thou who hadſt knowledge e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make me, haſt a perfect knowledge of what thou haſt made me. We may joyn it alſo with the later clauſe, <hi>None can deliver out of thine hand;</hi> Why? <hi>Thine hands have made me and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned me.</hi> Is it poſſible for the work to deliver it ſelf out of the hand of him who wrought it? Is that which is formed too ſtrong for him that formed it, when as the ſame hand which gave it form, gave it ſtrength? We finde this argument as to the former part (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.9.) where from the work of God in our naturall conſtitution, the holy pen-man proves the fulneſſe of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge concerning us in every condition; <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand ye brutiſh</hi> (he ſpeaks to men, who acted more like beaſts then men) <hi>He that planted the ear, Shall he not hear? He that formed the eye ſhall he not ſee?</hi> As if he had ſaid, He that made the ear, is all hearing; and he who formed the eye, is all eye, all ſight. The argument holds ſtrong from Gods power in forming man, to his power of knowing man, and to his power of diſpoſing man.<note place="margin">I am teneo huj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </note> That's the firſt way of dependance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Job</hi> may be conceived, as rendering an account of thoſe things about which he had taken the boldneſſe to interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Lord, at the third verſe. Here he anſwers his own que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; as if he had ſaid, now I ſee well enough why thou maiſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:51057:247"/> and deſtroy thy work, <hi>It is thy work;</hi> I will go no further for a reaſon to vindicate thee in breaking me to pieces then this, <hi>That thine hands have ſet me together: Thou haſt made me,</hi> and thou maieſt unmake me; thou haſt rais'd me up, and thou maieſt pull me down. So the copulative <hi>(vau)</hi> in the originall, which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate by the adverſative, <hi>yet,</hi> is taken for a conjunction cauſall; and ſo it is frequently uſed in Scripture (<hi>Gen.</hi> 30.20.) <hi>Dust thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return;</hi> The ſenſe is, <hi>Duſt thou art, therefore to duſt thou ſhalt return</hi> (Exod. 15.23, 24.) <hi>The waters were bitter, and the people murmured;</hi> that is, <hi>The waters were bitter, therefore the people murmured;</hi> thus here, <hi>Thine hands have made me and faſhioned me, therefore thou doſt deſtroy me.</hi> He that builds the houſe at his own charge, and by his own power, may ruin it at his own pleaſure.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Ex ſua forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione artificis miſericordiam movet, &amp; ex commemorato priſtino benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio, alia denuò efflagitandi an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam arripit. <hi>Pined.</hi>
                     </note>Thirdly, The words may carry the ſenſe of a ſtrong motive to prevail with God, to handle <hi>Job</hi> more gently, or to deal more tenderly with him; why? The Lord had beſtowed much care and coſt to make and faſhion him: therefore he will ſurely pity and ſpare him. There is a naturall motion of the heart in every agent, towards the preſervation of that which proceedeth from it. Creation is followed with providence. If a ſpeechleſſe and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe creature could ſpeak and underſtand, it would argue with it's maker (in <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe) as <hi>Job</hi> doth, <hi>Doſt thou yet deſtroy me? David</hi> ſtrengthens his heart to ask good at the hands of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſpoken good concerning him (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27.) <hi>Thou, O Lord of Hosts, God of Iſrael, haſt revealed to thy ſervant, ſaying, I will build thee an houſe, therefore hath thy ſervant found in his heart to pray this praier unto thee.</hi> Now, if <hi>David</hi> were not only em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned to ask, but even aſſured to receive mercy, becauſe God promiſed to build him a houſe, that is, to proſper his eſtate and family, how much more might <hi>Job</hi> be encouraged to pray for, and expect mercy from the hand of God, becauſe God had already framed and built that naturall houſe, his body? The Prophet <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah</hi> being about to plead with God for new mercies, preſents him with a catalogue of his old mercies (<hi>Chap.</hi> 63.7, 8, 9.) <hi>I will mention the loving kindeneſſes of the Lord, and the praiſes of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath done unto us, and the great goodneſſe towards the houſe of Iſrael, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving kindeneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> &amp;c.

As if he had ſaid, That great ſea of thy goodneſſe hath ſent out abundant ſtreams of good things heretofore, and are all thoſe ſtreams now dried up, and the ſprings exhauſted? What's become of thy zeal and ſtrength and compaſſions? Are they all ſpent and gone?

                     </note> thou haſt done thus and thus for me, and wilt thou now deſtroy me?

                     <p>Hands are often aſcribed to God, as was ſhewed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. Many things are made with the hand; The maker of all things is without hands, and yet he is all hand. Hence all things that were made, are ſaid to be made by the hands of God; not only the forming of man, but the forming of the heavens and of the earth, is the work of his hand (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.5. both are put together) (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.13.) <hi>Mine hand alſo hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath ſpanned the heavens.</hi> Whereſoever the great works of God are expreſt, a hand uſually is expreſt as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment working them, yet his hand wrought the leaſt as well as the greateſt, a worm of the earth, as well as man upon the earth, or the Angels in heaven.</p>
                     <p>The heads of men have run into great variety of opinion, about theſe hands forming man.</p>

                     <p>Others expound hands literally and formally, not as if God had hands (that's below their conceit) but thus, It hath been ſaid of old, that when God at firſt formed man, the Sonne took upon him an outward ſhape, or the ſhape of a man; and ſo (ſay they) Chriſt (not made man, but) in the form of man form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The hands of God are all ſecond cauſes, which God uſeth toward the production of any effect.<note place="margin">Cauſis ſecundis veluti quibuſda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> manibus utitur Deus ad produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendas res ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunares. <hi>Aquin.</hi>
                        </note> All hands work for God, they work for him, while they are ſet a work againſt him; and ſo may be called, <hi>The hands of God.</hi> Mans making ſince the Creation, is not an immediate work; the Creation of the firſt man was. Yet it is ſo much the work of God ſtill, that every man is the work of his hands, as well as the firſt man. All inferiour cauſes concurring to the making of man are the hands, by which God maketh man.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The hands of God, are generally taken for the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſdom of God. The hand of power acts, what the hand of wiſdom doth contrive. As the hand is often put for power, ſo to put any thing into the hand of another, is to put it into his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. That grant which was made to Satan at the beginning of this book, runs in this ſtrain, <hi>Behold, be</hi> (meaning <hi>Job) is in thine hand</hi> (that is, Thou maiſt do with him what thou wilt) <hi>only ſave his life</hi> (Chap. 2.6.)</p>
                     <p>The Schoolmen determine the hands of God to be the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and will of God,</hi> which they call, <hi>The executive power of God;</hi> by theſe he determines what ſhall be done, and doth what he predetermines. The very decree and purpoſe of God, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the hand of God (<hi>Act.</hi> 4.28.) <hi>Of a truth, againſt thy holy childe Ieſus, whom thou haſt anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Iſrael were gathered together, for to doe whatſoever thy hand, and thy counſel determined before to be done.

                     <p>This word is tranſlated alſo to grieve, vex, or to put one to trouble.

Some have put ignoble titles upon the body of man, calling it a priſon, or a ſhackle.

                           </gap>.</note>But the Apoſtle (<hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21.) calleth our body, <hi>a vile body,</hi> or the body of our vileneſſe. Mans body is not vile, as God made it (ſo it is a ſtately ſtructure) but as ſin hath made it. The
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:51057:250"/> Apoſtle cals it vile, not abſolutely, and in it ſelf, but relatively. The body clothed with mortality is vile, compared with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, when it ſhall be clothed with glory, and that glory like the glory of the body of Chriſt, as is aſſured us, <hi>Who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body;</hi> The words carry an alluſion to thoſe who changing old and broken veſſels, deſire to have them wrought in the beſt, and neweſt faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The body of Chriſt is the richeſt piece of Gods work, and this ſhall be the patern of ours; as here upon earth the ſpirits of believers are of the ſame faſhion with Chriſts (the ſame minde is in the Saints, which was in Chriſt, there is but one draft of grace (in the main) upon the ſouls of all holy men, and that is a copy of Chriſts, his being the originall) So in heaven the bodies of all believers ſhall be of the ſame faſhion with Chriſts. There ſhall be but one draft of glory in the main (for degrees do not vary the kinde) upon the body of Chriſt, and the bodies of all his members. In reference to this future change of the body, the body in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, is vile.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Hence it follows, That as we muſt not undervalue the frame of mans body in generall, as imperfect; ſo we may not deſpiſe any for their ſpeciall bodily imperfections. It is God who hath made and faſhioned them round about. It is ſaid (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.8.) that the blinde and the lame were hated of <hi>Davids</hi> ſoul. Yet to hate any for defects in the body, is a very great defect in the ſoul: and to contemn any for naturall blemiſhes, is a ſpirituall blemiſh. How then could <hi>David</hi> hate the blinde and the lame, and not ſin, or are we to number this among his ſins? There are two expoſitions of thoſe words upon either of which we may clear the difficulty.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That when <hi>David</hi> ſent to ſummon that fort, the <hi>Iebuſites</hi> who were the defendants, truſting in the ſtrength of the place, told <hi>David</hi> in ſcorn that he muſt firſt conquer the blinde and the lame. As implying that blinde and lame ſouldiers, were gariſon good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to deal with his great Army upon the advantage of ſuch a fortreſſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The blinde and the lame, may rather be the Idols and ſtrange Gods which the <hi>Iebuſites</hi> worſhipped, of whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, they were not the leſſe confident, becauſe the Jews count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them but blinde and lame. As if they had ſaid, even theſe gods, which you call blinde and lame, ſee well enough what ye
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:51057:251"/> are doing, and will come faſt enough, and too faſt for your eaſe, to our aid and ſuccour. Theſe blinde and lame gods were juſtly hated of <hi>Davids</hi> ſoul, but he had learned better then to hate men, who were made lame or blinde by God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Seeing all men are faſhioned round about by the hands of God, then as we muſt not deſpiſe any for their bodily imperfections, ſo not envy any for their bodily perfections. Some are as much troubled to ſee another have a better bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or a more beautifull face, as many are (alike ſinfully both) to ſee another have a better purſe, or a more plentifull eſtate then themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Let not the thing formed, ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> If thy earthly Tabernacle be not ſo highly, ſo ſtrongly built, if the materials of it be not ſo pure, or not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly tempered, if thou haſt not ſo good a conſtitution, ſo elegant a compoſition, if thou art not ſo adorn'd and poliſh'd, as ſome others are; yet be not diſcontented, the hands of God have made and faſhioned thee round about. It is a great honour to a veſſel, that he made it, though he have made it (in this ſenſe) a veſſel of diſhonour.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, If God hath faſhioned our bodies, then we muſt not put them out of faſhion. It is dangerous to deface the work of God, to undo that which God hath done, to unmake that which God hath made. How ſad is it that any ſhould pull down a building of Gods own ſetting up, without warrant from God! Self-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or the murder of another, is an high affront to God, and ſhould have a ſevere revenge from man. He that ſheds his own bloud takes revenge upon himſelf, <hi>And who ſo ſheddeth mans bloud, by man ſhall his bloud be ſhed, for in the image of God made he man (Gen.</hi> 9.6.) As what God hath joyned by a civil, ſo by a naturall band, Let no man put aſunder.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, If thou art made and faſhioned by God, then let God have the uſe of all thou art. Let God dwell in the houſe, which he hath ſet up. Let thy body be imploied for God; he that made it, hath moſt right to it. Every thing in man ſhews forth the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſſe of God towards man, let every thing in man ſhew forth obedience and ſubmiſſion unto God. This was the ground of <hi>Davids</hi> praier (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.73.) <hi>Thy hands have made me and faſhioned me, give me understanding, that I may learn thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Lord, I would uſe this body, this
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:51057:251"/> ſoul, this all, which thou haſt made, for thy glory, therefore give me underſtanding that I may learn thy will, I would not do the will of another, while I dwell in thy houſe, and am thy tenant at will. I would not imploy thoſe members which thou haſt given me, to fulfill the Law of ſin, or the commands of Satan. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle is clear upon this argument in reference to redemption (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19.) <hi>Ye are not your own, ye are bought with a price; therefore glorifie God with your bodies, and in your spirits, which are Gods;</hi> Now as in the work of redemption we are of God by grace, ſo in the work of creation we are of God by nature. The reaſon holds in both, glorifie God with your bodies, which are not your own, but Gods. It is uſuall in letting out of houſes to put a clauſe in the leaſe, that the houſe ſhall not be imploied to ſuch and ſuch uſes, but only to ſuch as are expreſſed in the inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Surely the Lord who hath built and furniſhed theſe houſes, hath taught us how to imploy them, and what trade to exerciſe in them, even the trade of holines. Take heed you do not let out any room or corner of a room in this houſe for ſin to trade in, or for the work of iniquity. This is to let out a houſe of Gods making to the devils uſing.</p>

                        <hi>It repented the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> Gen. 6.6.) <hi>that he had made man, and it grieved him at the heart.</hi> This repentance and grief did not ariſe from his making of man; but from that neceſſity which his own juſtice and honour laid upon him to deſtroy man whom he had made; as it follows in the next words, <hi>And the Lord ſaid, I will deſtroy man whom I have created.</hi> The words ſhew the reſolution of God, not his propenſion; it went to his
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:51057:252"/> heart to do it. If God repented and grieved (underſtand both by a figure) becauſe he had made man, whom he muſt deſtroy, then it cannot but be a grief to him to deſtroy that which he hath made. It is as eaſie to the power of God to undo, as it is to do: but it is not ſo eaſie to his will to undo, as it is to do.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve, <hi>Afflictions deſtructive to the outward man, may be the lot of the beſt men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God never deſtroies that ſpirituall creature, which the hand of his grace hath made and faſhioned: but he doth ſometimes deſtroy the naturall creature of thoſe who are ſpirituall.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Obſerve, <hi>A good man will make honourable mention of the goodneſſe of God to him, while he is under greatest evils.</hi>

                        <hi>Job</hi> writes the naturall hiſtory of Gods power and wiſdom in his conſtitution, while deſtruction was knocking at his doors. Though God will deſtroy what he hath made, yet he ought to be glorified for what he hath made. The praiſe of God for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioning us, is never ſo comely, as when he is putting us out of faſhion.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Obſerve, <hi>God doth that ſometimes which is moſt impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he ſhould do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He acts ſtrangely in waies of mercy, and ſtrangely in waies of judgement. He ſaves thoſe whom we expect he ſhould deſtroy, and he deſtroies thoſe whom we expect he ſhould ſave. <hi>The Kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world would not have believed that the adverſary and the enemy ſhould have entred into the gates of Jeruſalem</hi> (Lam. 4.12.) and who would have believed that the adverſary and the enemy, ſorrow and deſtruction ſhould have entred into the gates of <hi>Job?</hi> God comes with ſuch afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon his people now, as make him to be admired by all the world.

The Hebrews expreſſe man, or a male childe, by a word of that root, and they give two reaſons of it. Either, firſt, becauſe man is of a ſtronger memory then the woman. Or, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe the man-childe preſerveth the memory of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and is a monument of his fathers honour, his name being carried on from generation to generation; in oppoſition to which, women or females are called <hi>Naſhim,</hi> which vvord impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>forgetfulneſſe,</hi> becauſe the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Memory or the act of remembring is improperly applied to God. For remembrance is of things paſt, but to God all things are preſent. Memory is the ſtore-houſe wherein vve lay up ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall notions, and keep records of vvhat hath been done, which by an act of the underſtanding vve review and fetch out again. All things are ever open before God. He needs not turn leaves or ſearch regiſters, he needs not ſo much as ſtrain a thought to recall vvhat is paſt; that vvhich vvas from the beginning, and ſhall be to the end, yea, to that vvhich hath no end, eternity, is alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. God is ſaid to remember, or to forget vvhen he acts like a man, vvho remembers or forgets; but there is no act either of forgetfulneſſe, or of remembrance in God.</p>
                     <p>Remembring implieth two things in God.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, A ſerious attention to the perſon and conſideration of the thing vvhich he formerly ſeemed to ſlight, or lightly to paſſe by. We alſo remember by minding and thinking upon vvhat is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as well as by recalling what is paſt.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To remember, notes a ſpeedy ſupply of our wants, or actuall deliverance out of dangers. God remembers us when he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours us, he remembers us, when he pities us, he remembers us, when he relieves us, <hi>Who remembred us in our low eſtate,</hi> Pſal 136.23. that is, who brought us out of our low eſtate. <hi>The needy ſhall not alway be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten</hi>
                        <pb n="501" facs="tcp:51057:253"/> (Pſal. 9.18.) not alway, no nor at any time, the Lord doth not at all forget any, much leſſe ſuch needy ones, as that Scripture intends. The meaning is, they ſhall not alway be undelivered, their eſtate ſhall not lie for ever unconſidered, and their cry unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to. God will not deal with them, nor ſuffer others to deal with them, as if he had forgotten them. <hi>Hannah</hi> was long under that affliction of barrenneſſe, and when the Lord gave her conception, it is ſaid, <hi>He remembred Hannah</hi> (1 Sam. 1.19.) his thoughts were ever upon her, and upon her petition, but when he granted her petition, then he remembred her indeed. As we then remember God, when we obey his commands: ſo God remembers us then, when he fulfils our requeſts. <hi>Remember, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As it is our duty to remember the Lord: ſo it is our priviledge that we may put him in remembrance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a priviledge, and a very great one to be a <hi>remembrancer to the king of heaven.</hi> The Prophet deſcribes ſuch an office (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.6.) <hi>Ye that make mention of the Lord,</hi> or nearer the Hebrew, <hi>Ye that are the Lords remembrancers, keep not ſilence, and give him no reſt.</hi> Great Princes have an officer called their <hi>Remembrancer,</hi> and they need remembrancers. It is at once their honour and their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to have them. They cannot retain all buſineſſes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a record within themſelves of all affairs within their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms: It is an honour to God that he hath <hi>remembrancers,</hi> but it is his greater honour that he hath no need of them. Himſelf is the living record of all that hath been done, or is to be done. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is above memory, and he that knows all things is above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers. God is willing we ſhould ſpeak to him after the manner of men: but we muſt not conceive of him after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men. We muſt not think he hath forgotten us, though we may beſeech him to remember us.</p>
                     <p>There are four things which the Saints uſually move the Lord to remember.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, His own mercies, <hi>Remember, O Lord thy tender mercies,</hi> was <hi>Davids</hi> praier (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.6.) <hi>Hath God forgotten to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?</hi> was <hi>Davids</hi> queſtion and infirmity (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.9.) yet God acts ſometimes, as if he had forgot his nature, or had need to be minded to do what he is. God can no more forget himſelf, then deny himſelf, no more forget to be gracious then ceaſe to be: yet he gives his people leave, yea a charge, to move him to do, what
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:51057:254"/> he cannot but do, what he is reſolved, yea what he is ready to do. Mercy pleaſeth God ſo much, that he often appears diſpleaſed on purpoſe, that we may remember him of his mercy. He delights we ſhould deſire, what he delights to grant.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Saints uſually minde God of his Covenant. <hi>God is ever mindefull of his Covenant</hi> (Pſal. 111.5.) yet he loves to be minded of it. His royall title is, The God that keepeth Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for ever; yet he loves to be deſired not to break it. Thus <hi>Jeremy</hi> begs for the Jews, the Covenant-people of God. <hi>Do not abhor us for thy name ſake, Do not diſgrace the throne of thy glory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, break not thy Covenant with us.</hi> Jer. 14.21. The Pſalmiſt praies upon the ſame ground, <hi>Have reſpect to the Covenant, for the dark places of the earth, are full of the habitations of cruelty;</hi> As if he had ſaid, Lord, Thou haſt made a Covenant to preſerve and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect thy people, but now they are oppreſſed; The <hi>dark places,</hi> that is, places full of ignorance and wickedneſſe (which are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall darkneſſe) are full of cruelty: Holy knowledge hath no ſuch enemy as ignorance. Or <hi>the dark places are full,</hi> &amp;c. may be thus underſtood, there is no ſuch obſcure corner or by-place in the land, but their malice ſearcheth it out for the vexation of thy people. We are ſo far from having liberty to ſerve thee publikely in the light, that we feel the cruelty of bloudy minded men, though we do it ſecretly or in the dark. Now Lord it is time for thee to remember thy Covenant.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Saints uſe to put God in remembrance of the rage and blaſphemies of his and their enemies. Thus the Church of the Jews cries unto the Lord (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.7.) <hi>Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom in the day of Ieruſalem, who ſaid, raſe it, raſe it, even to the foundation thereof.</hi> When a man is wrong'd who intends revenge, he will ſay to the party wronging him, well, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this,</hi> or, <hi>I ſhall remember you for this.</hi> Revengefull men have ſtrong memories: ſo hath the God to whom vengeance belongeth. He will certainly remember the ſinfull, revengefull cry of <hi>Edom</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though the ſins of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did cry to him for vengeance. The Pſalmiſt is as earneſt in another place, urging the Lord to remember for his own intereſt, as here for the intereſt of his <hi>Sion</hi> (Pſal. 74.18.) <hi>Remember this, that the enemy hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, O Lord, and that the fooliſh people have blaſphemed thy Name.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Pray, Lord, take a note of this, make a <hi>memorandum</hi> of this, <hi>That the enemy hath reproached thy Name:</hi> God
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:51057:254"/> will remember it, if any of his ſervants are reproached, much more when himſelf is.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The Saints remember God of their own frailty, and that two-fold. Firſt, Naturall, Secondly, Spirituall. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how ſhort my time is, wherefore hast thou made all men in vain? (Pſal.</hi> 89.47.) Man is a frail ſhort-liv'd creature, and it is ſome comfort to him, that God knows he is ſo. That which <hi>Job</hi> puts the Lord in remembrance of, is his naturall frailty; ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it alſo of his ſpirituall, <hi>Remember, I beſeech thee,</hi>
                        <q>That thou haſt made me as the clay.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The LXX reads it, <hi>Thou haſt made me clay.</hi>

                        </note> The word ſignifies ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or morter, which are mixt of earth &amp; water, Thou haſt made me as tempered clay. When the originall of man is deſcribed,<note place="margin">Propriè ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat cementum, vel terram aqua mixtam.</note> it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord formed man duſt out of the ground,</hi> or, <hi>of the duſt of the ground (Gen.</hi> 2.7.) here <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt made me as the clay,</hi> or, <hi>Thou hast made me of the clay;</hi> the ſenſe is near the ſame, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we take <hi>clay</hi> for the matter out of which man was made, or for the ſimilitude according to which man was made. <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf with reſpect to creation: for,<note place="margin">In memoriam revoca, ut me è luto primùm, <hi>i. e.</hi> primum homine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unde orti caeteri formaris. figuli more. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                        </note> according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of generation, man is not made of clay. The firſt man was made of clay, and of him all men are. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive our pedigree from the dirt, and are a kin to clay. <hi>Job</hi> might ſay, and ſo may any man, <hi>Thou haſt made me of the clay.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Job</hi> was, and <hi>man now is made as the clay;</hi> that is, frail, brittle and weak. We are compoſed of materials, which will quickly crack and break. When the holy Ghoſt would deſcribe how eaſily Chriſt can ſhatter to pieces all the oppoſites of his Kingdom, it is ſaid, <hi>He ſhall daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſel:</hi> A potters veſſel will not bear blows, eſpecially not the blows of ſuch an inſtrument, as is there ſpoken of, <hi>an iron rod: He ſhall break them with a rod of iron</hi> (Pſal. 2.9.) we may break a potters veſſel with a little wand, or a weak reed, how then ſhould it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the weight and hardneſſe of an iron rod? The Spirit of God ſeems to delight in this alluſion, and therefore takes it up often, Read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. We have the ſtate of the Jews, deſcribed under this notion (<hi>Jer.</hi> 18.4.) The Lord bids <hi>Jeremy</hi> go down to the potters houſe, he obeys, and found the potter working a work on the wheel, <hi>And the veſſel that he made of clay, was marred in the hand of the potter, ſo he made it again ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:51057:255"/> veſſel, as ſeemed good to the potter to make it. Then, the Word of the Lord came to him, ſaying, Cannot I do to you as this potter? ſaith the Lord, Behold, as the clay is in the hand of the potter, ſo are ye in my hand, O houſe of Iſrael.</hi> I can form you, and I can break you, I can put you into what condition I pleaſe, and ye ought not to be diſpleaſed at it. A potters veſſel is an embleme of the ſtrongeſt Kingdoms, How much more of the ſtrongeſt men?</p>
                     <p>That we are made of clay, intimates three things, at all which <hi>Job</hi> ſeemeth to aim, when he ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt made me as the clay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, The excellency of mans frame. He is not thruſt together like a rude lump or maſſe of earth, but <hi>curiouſly wrought</hi> (Pſal. 139.15.) To make a veſſel of clay is an artificiall work, not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall. It requireth much pains, but more skill. Whence <hi>Job</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth, <hi>Thou haſt made me as the clay;</hi> Thou haſt ſhewed thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wiſdome in ſhaping and contriving me, as a veſſel of honour for thy uſe, <hi>And wilt thou bring me into duſt again?</hi> The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that love and care which God hath laid out upon us in our conſtitution, is an argument moving him to pity and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as was ſhewed at the third verſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That God hath made us of clay, ſhews our utter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to contend with God, and to ſtand againſt his ſtroaks: It is, as if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Lord, Surely thou forgetteſt of what mettall I am made, thou thinkeſt I am made of a hard rock, or of invincible A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant, that I am compounded of iron, and other the ſtrongeſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials; Alas, Lord, there is no ſuch matter, I am made but as the clay; A great deal of power and wiſdome appeared in making me, but a little power will ſerve to ruine me; I am no ſooner toucht but crackt. Why then doſt thou plant all thy Ordnance, and diſcharge ſo many vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys of ſhot against me? Lord, What am I? Am I a wall of braſſe, or a bulwark of ſtone? Thou knowest I am but a wall of clay, a paper wall, a potters veſſel, a little moistened earth. Will any man prepare Cannon to batter a cottage, or a beetle to kill a flie? Thy providence needs not make ſuch proviſion againſt me, or handle me ſo roughly: that which is weak cals for tender uſage, and that which is weak may laſt long, if tenderly uſed; a glaſſe with care will continue many ages. Deal gently with thy ſervant, Remember, I beſeech thee, thou haſt made me as the clay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>That we are made as the clay,</hi> ſhews our eaſineſſe to be
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:51057:255"/> overcome by temptation, and our obnoxiouſneſſe to ſin. Sin is (in its kinde) as ſpirituall, as grace is, yet our ſinfull corruption is figuratively called, <hi>the fleſh.</hi>

As the ſenſitive part is a ſervant, ſo a ſnare to the rationall, much more to the ſpirituall. The fleſh is at once the organ, and the burthen of the ſpirit. The Apoſtle calling Saints to run the race of holineſſe with patience, gives a very ſutable advice, <hi>Let us lay aſide every weight,</hi> that is, all carnall comber; he that would ſhew himſelf light of foot, will not take a burden upon his back, he caſts off his very garments; to which the next words of the Apoſtle ſeem to allude, <hi>Caſt off every weight, and the ſinne which doth ſo eaſily beſet us:</hi> So a garment doth, eſpecially a long gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which in running daggles and folds about our heels. The reaſon why our ſinfull corruption is compared to ſuch a garment, is, becauſe it is ſo much aſſiſted by this body of clay, the fleſh, which is as a long garment to the ſoul, hanging about it, and beſetting it, on every ſide.</p>
                     <p>From which ſenſe <hi>Iob</hi> ſeems thus to move the Lord, <hi>Suppoſe I have ſinned</hi> (he had ſaid, verſ. 7. <hi>Thou knoweſt I am not wicked, but ſuppoſe I have ſinned) and have had my failings, yet, Lord, Remember thou haſt made me as the clay, I am not a pure ſpirit, as Angels are, I have a body of earth about me, which clogs and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders me in every duty, which many waies endangers me unto every ſinne.</hi> God himſelf takes up this as an argument to ſpare ſinfull man (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.39.) when the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> rebelled againſt him, <hi>He many a time turned his anger away, and did not ſtir up all his wrath.</hi> What ſtaid him? The next words give a reaſon; <hi>for he remembred that they were but fleſh;</hi> that is, weak and very ſubject unto ſin. This argument prevails again (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.14.) <hi>Like as a father spareth his children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him; Why? For he knoweth their frame, he remembreth that they are duſt.</hi> As if the very matter out of which man was firſt made, though without ſin, were ſome diſadvantage to him in the reſiſting of ſin. It was a diſadvantage before man had any ſinne in him, how much more is it now, when moſt men have nothing at all in them, but ſin, and the beſt have very much. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.6.) <hi>is fleſh.</hi> His meaning is, corrupt nature can produce none but corrupt acts. It is a truth alſo, that our <hi>pure nature,</hi> becauſe it was conſtituted (as of other parts, ſo)
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:51057:256"/> of fleſh (the ſoul like a ſparkling diamond, being ſet in clay) was thereby rendered more prone to fleſhly or ſinfull acts. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall fleſh (in its beſt ſtate) is more apt to bring forth spirituall fleſh (namely ſinne) then a spirit is.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Angeli idcirco irremiſſibilitèr peccaverunt, quia tanto robu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius ſtare pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant quanto eos carnis commix tio non tenebat. <hi>Greg.</hi> Moral in loc</note> And that's a reaſon among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which ſome give, why God was ſo irreconcilably angry with the Angels which fell, why he did never ſo much as mention them in a way of mercy, or diſcovered a thought of them for good ſince their fall (I ſay) one reaſon given is this, <hi>Becauſe God could not remember that Angels were made as the clay, or formed out of the duſt;</hi> They were created ſpirits, pure ſpirits, they had no clogs of fleſh and bloud about them, no fogs, no miſts vapouring up from a ſenſitive part to cloud their intellectuall. They had the more power to continue pure, becauſe they were free from any earthly and elementary mixtures. Their ſin was a compound of more evils, becauſe their nature was ſo ſimple. Angels having no tempter without them, no fleſh about them, turned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves away from God, meerly upon the freedom of their own wils. As every good action is by ſo much the better, by how much it hath a freer concurrence of our wils: ſo is every evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo much the worſe. The ſinne we commit is the greater, by how much we have had the leſſe provocation to commit it. The ſinne of our firſt parents in eating the forbidden fruit, was aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated in it ſelf, becauſe God gave them ſuch plenty and variety of other fruits to eat: but it was leſſened in compariſon of the Angels ſinne, becauſe they had more provocations to ſinne, then the Angels had. The bait of the temptation againſt our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, was laid in their conſtitution, which being corporall and earthly, muſt needs be delighted with earthly objects. <hi>The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit was pleaſant to the eye,</hi> there the fleſh took it, <hi>And it was pleaſant to the taſte,</hi> there the fleſh took it again. Theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations man had over and beſides that of the Angels, a hope or a deſire to mend his condition, and to become like unto God. A body of earth hath a ſutableneſſe to all earthly allurements. Every like hath a naturall tendency and motion towards its like. This moves the Lord to pity ſinfull man, though man muſt not hence plead impunity for ſinne. The meaſure and degrees of ſin upon ſuch actings are abated, but the acts do not therefore put off the nature of ſinne. <hi>A ſinner in duſt and clay cannot be excuſed, yet is not ſo much polluted, and more to be pitied then a ſinning spirit.</hi> And that's a third notion in which we may expound <hi>Iob,</hi> beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:51057:256"/> God to <hi>remember, that he hath made him as the clay.</hi>

And therefore though God formed man (as the holy ſtory informs us (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7.) out of the duſt of the earth, yet ſo long as man ſtood, he never ſaid to him, <hi>To duſt thou ſhalt return;</hi> God only put a ſuppoſition, that in caſe man did fall, he ſhould ſurely die. But when man had fallen by ſin, then he hears what he was, and what he muſt be, <hi>For duſt thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return</hi> (Gen. 3.19.) As if God had thus beſpoken ſinfull man. <hi>Thy body was framed out of dust,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:51057:257"/> and now I charge this burden upon thee, thou ſhalt return to the duſt again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a Queſtion (and I ſhall touch upon it.) Whether death were naturall to man or no? Whether man were made mortall, or whether he made himſelf mortall? Some affirm, That death was naturall, not accidentall or occaſionall to man-kinde. They argue for this opinion,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, thus, <hi>Adam</hi> died not the death of the body, or a naturall death, when he had ſinned, therefore the death of the body was not inflicted for ſin upon his perſon, and his poſterity, but was ſeated in, or a conſequent of his nature.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, Though <hi>Adam</hi> died not preſently a naturall death, yet he was preſently made ſubject or liable unto death; the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was paſt upon him, though the ſentence was not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon him. A malefactour who is caſt at the barre, is a dead man in law, though he be reprieved from the preſent ſtroke of death.</p>
                     <p>Again, Though death it ſelf did not inſtantly ſeize upon him, yet the ſymptoms of death, and tokens of mortality did. Fear and ſhame, pains and diſtempers, ſweat and wearineſſe quickly ſhewed themſelves as ſo many harbingers or forerunners of his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſolution: we ſee and feel death in theſe, before we ſee or feel death it ſelf. Theſe bid us prepare our bodies for the grave, and our ſouls for heaven.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Others reaſon thus, Chriſt hath delivered his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the elect, from all that puniſhment, which the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> did contract and deſerve; but Chriſt hath not delivered his elect, his own people, from turning to the duſt. Godly men die as well as the ungodly, believers as well as infidels, therefore (ſay they) the death of the body was not procured by ſin.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer, Whatſoever is an evil in death, Chriſt hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his people from; he hath taken away all that from death, which is puniſhment or annoiance, though death be not taken away. Chriſt hath freed us from the effects of ſin, as he hath freed us from ſin it ſelf, that is, from their prevalence and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over us, not from their preſence or being in and upon us. Hence the Apoſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) triumpheth over death, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Death once had a power over man to ſting him to death, death once had a victorious power, and would have bin the great
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:51057:258" rendition="simple:additions"/> conquerour, riding in triumph over all the poſterity of <hi>Adam:</hi> but now death hath neither ſting nor ſword to uſe againſt belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, it hath nothing of victory over the Saints. It is now but a ſleep, a ſleep in Chriſt, a reſt from labour, a putting off the rags, the worn rags of mortality, that we may be dreſs'd in the robes of glory. The evil of death is removed, and that which remains of death (the ſeparation of ſoul and body) proves the greateſt good to both, it being but a preparatory to their everlaſting union.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It is argued, That death and corruption were natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to man, becauſe the matter out of which man was made, was dying and corruptible;<note place="margin">Omne principi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atum ſequitur naturam prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiorum.</note> for that which is made, muſt follow the nature of that principle out of which it is made. The effect cannot be (ſay they) more noble then the cauſe, nor the ſubject conſtituted, more durable then that which goes into its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
                     <p>To clear up an anſwer to this, we muſt diſtinguiſh of a three-fold immortality.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. A primitive, ſimple, independent, eſſentiall immortality; this is proper and peculiar to God, in which ſenſe the Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, <hi>He only hath immortality</hi> (1 Tim. 6.16.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There is a derivative, dependant, eſſentiall immortality. Some ſubſtances have no ſeed of corruptibility, nor of death in them. Being either ſeparate from all matter, which is the ſeat and root of corruption, as the Angels, or united to matter, yet ſo as not being produced from it, or having any affinity with it, ſuch are the ſouls of men. Whole man in his creation was not immortall either of theſe waies;<note place="margin">

                     <p n="3">3. There is an immortality by the power or gift, by the mercy or juſtice of God. The power and juſtice of God ſhall give an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to the bodies of the damned in hell, they ſhall ever live a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, who were dead all while they lived.

                     <p>The power, goodneſſe and mercy of God, ſhall much more
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:51057:258"/> give immortality to the bodies of the Saints in glory; they who have had a will to delight in obeying God that ſhort time they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on earth, ſhall have a power to live for ever in delight, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God in heaven.</p>

                        <hi>was the law of Adams life. Adam</hi> had not an impoſſibility to die, but a poſſibility not to die; This was the ſtate of immortality in the ſtate of innocency. Man had not fallen into the grave, if he had not fallen into tranſgreſſion. His life was made as long as his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if he had not turned from God, he had not returned to the earth. Death was convaied in by ſin, and our poſſibility not to die, was not only loſt, but changed into a neceſſity of dying. So then, man is brought to duſt, not becauſe his nature was ſubject to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but becauſe ſin hath corrupted his nature. When he abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the liberty of his will, he was ſubjected to this neceſſity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will. By an irreverſible ordinance of heaven, <hi>It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto men once to die,</hi> Heb. 9.27. <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaks, to that point of Gods law concerning man, <hi>Thou haſt made me as the clay, and thou wilt bring me into the duſt again.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the words are taken as an aſſertion of the power and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of God, to unmake and pull down man, whom he had made and ſet up.</p>
                     <p>If we read the words by way of interrogation or admiration: ſo <hi>Iob</hi> ſeems to intend them as an allay to mitigate the preſent ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the Lords proceeding with him, <hi>Thou haſt made me of the clay, but a while ago, and wilt thou bring me into the duſt again? O ſpare me a little before I go hence, and ſhall be ſeen no more:</hi> It will not be long before there muſt be an end of me, O let me have a more comfortable being and breathing, while I am here.</p>
                     <p>When Satan provoked the Lord againſt <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to deſtroy it, the Lord anſwered (<hi>Zech.</hi> 3.2.) <hi>Is not this a brand pluckt out of the fire?</hi> As if he had ſaid unto Satan, Art thou moving me to throw this people into that fire of affliction, out of which they were ſo lately ſnatcht? <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was in the fire but awhile ago, and ſhall I caſt it in again? <hi>Iob</hi> pleads in the ſame form, though not in the ſame matter, I was clay but the other day, and Lord, ſhall I to duſt again to day? Let we ſee ſome quiet daies, before I ſee the end of my daies. Gild over this clay of mine with the
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:51057:259"/> ſhinings of thy face upon me, before thou rendereſt me duſt again.</p>
                     <p>I have more then once had occaſion to touch this argument, and ſhall therefore paſſe it here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iob</hi> having thus ſet forth his naturall conſtitution, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, as he was made of clay, goeth on to deſcribe himſelf more diſtinctly; firſt, in his conception of his whole body; ſecondly, in the formation and delineation of his parts.</p>

                        <hi>Sinews</hi> or nerves derive their pedigree from the brain, and are the organs by which the animall ſpirits are conveyed, and flow into the whole body, and with them both ſenſe and motion. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news have ſo much of ſtrength in them, that the ſame word is put to ſignifie both ſtrength and ſinews, and to do a thing ſtrongly and vigorouſly, is to doe it <hi>(nervosè)</hi> ſinewouſly. It is wonderfull which Naturaliſts write of the conjugations and uſes of the ſinews, to whoſe labours I referre the ſtudious Reader for further ſatisfaction. I have given enough to ſhew, what this Text cals me to, <hi>That God hath indeed clothed man with skin and fleſh, and fenced him with bones and ſinews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some have quarrelled with the wiſdom and goodneſſe of God, for turning man altogether naked and unarmed into the world. This Scripture is enough to confute the unreaſonableneſſe of that quarrel. <hi>Job</hi> thankfully acknowledgeth, That he was <hi>both cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and armed,</hi> though not in the ſenſe of theſe complainers. It is more honourable for man to make himſelf artificiall clothing and arms, then to have had none but naturall; God hath given man
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:51057:261"/> reaſon to invent, hands to prepare, and a tongue to call for thoſe things which by a Law of nature are impoſed upon other creatures; the power of reaſon, and the skill of the hand are a better ſafeguard to man then any the beaſts have, and can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide whatſoever man wants to ſecure him either from cold or danger. And though the body, as now it ſtands, be but (as it were) the ſepulchre of that which God at firſt created, though we lie open to ſo many diſeaſes and deaths, that the ſoul may well be ſaid to inhabit an unwalled, and an unfortified City, yet man hath great cauſe for ever to extoll the bounty of God in thoſe ſtill continued ennoblements of this earthly manſion, his mortall body. Yea, The noble ſtructure and ſymmetry of our bodies, invites our ſouls not only to thankfulneſſe, but to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. One of the Ancients ſtileth man <hi>a great miracle.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>The miracle of miracles:</hi> A third, <hi>The meaſure of all things:</hi> A fourth, <hi>The patern of the univerſe, the worlds epitome, The world in a ſmall volume, or a little world.</hi> They alſo have diſtinguiſhed the whole frame of the body into three ſtories, in alluſion to a like frame obſervable in the world. Firſt, The ſuperiour, which they call intellectuall or angelicall, becauſe they conceived it to be the habitation of Angels or Intelligences. The ſecond or middle part they call celeſtiall or heavenly, the ſeat of the Sunne and ſtarres. The third, Elementary, in which all corporeall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are procreated and nouriſhed. This diviſion of the world is eminent in man, for he alſo is a building of three ſtories. The head which is the ſeat of reaſon, the manſion, the tower of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and underſtanding is placed higheſt: the breſt or middle venter is the celeſtiall part, wherein the heart, like the Sun is predominant; ſome have called the Sun, <hi>The heart of the world;</hi> and the heart, <hi>The Sunne of mans body,</hi> by whoſe luſtre, beams and influences, all the other parts are quickned and refreſhed; hence we ſay, when the heart fails all fails, and while the heart holds, all holds. The third part of the body, or the lower ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter containing all parts neceſſary for the nutrition of individuals, or the propagation of the ſpecies, carrieth a cleare reſemblance with the elementary or loweſt parts of the univerſe.</p>
                     <p>There are five things in particular, which as ſo many rounds of a lather, may help us to raiſe our thoughts higher in the duty of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admiration about this work of God.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That God frameth up this goodly and beautifull fabrique
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:51057:262"/> out of ſuch mean and improbable materials. To conſider out of what ſtuff our bodies are made, advanceth the honour of him who made us. Man can make his work (except the form) no better then the matter out of which he formeth it. But as the form of mans body is better then the matter, ſo the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes better then it was, before it received that form.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The matter out of which God maketh man is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally homogeneall, or but of one kinde, yet there is a ſtrange heterogeny or variety in the very ſubſtance, as well as in the ſhape of the ſeverall parts; which are therefore divided by the ſurvaiers of this building, into parts ſimilar and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar. Is it not incredible to meer reaſon, that one lump ſhould be ſpread out into thin, tender skin, wrought into ſoft fleſh, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended into tough ſinews, hardened into ſtrong bones; that one piece ſhould make an outward jerkin or caſſock of skin, an under garment of fleſh, columns and rafters of bones, bands and ties of ſinews; that the ſame ſhould make veins like chanels to carry, and blood like water to be carried into every part to moiſten and refreſh it? When an Artificer buildeth an houſe, he requires more materials then one, he muſt have ſtones and timber, iron, lead,<note place="margin">Quomodo ex re tantula &amp; ſibi ſimili, tamvariae &amp; diſcrepantes partes extite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt; haec profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto eſt ſtupenda omnino opifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to compleat his fabrique: but the Lord frameth all the parts, rooms and contrivances of the body out of one and the ſame maſſe. <hi>Thou doſt not know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with childe</hi> (Eccleſ. 11.5.) Who can know by a meer rationall demonſtration, how a ſolid ſubſtance ſhould grow out of that which is ſo fluid? And that parts materially, as well as figuratively unlike, ſhould ariſe out of a like matter?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The work of God in the framing of man is internall, as well as externall. A ſtatuary, or an engraver will make the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or pourtraiture of a man, but his work is all outward, he cannot make bowels, or faſhion a heart within, he cannot cut out veins, bones and ſinews. The greateſt wonders of creation are unſeen. God hath packt many rarities, myſteries, yea, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles together in mans cheſt. All the vitall inſtruments and wheels, whereby the watch of our life is perpetually moved from the firſt hour to the laſt, are locked up in a curious internall cabinet, where God himſelf prepared the pulleys, hung on the weights, and wound up the chime by the hand of his infinite power, without opening of any part; As our own learned
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:51057:262"/> Anatomiſt elegantly teacheth us in the Preface to his ſixth book.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The dimenſions, proportions and poiſe of mans body are ſo exact and due, that they are made the model of all ſtructures and artificials. Caſtles, Houſes, Ships, yea the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> was framed after the meaſure and plot of mans body. In him is found a circulate figure, and a perfect quadrat, yea the true qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drature of a circle, whoſe imaginary lines have ſo much troubled the Mathematicians of many ages.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, In every part uſefulneſſe and commodiouſneſſe, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and convenience meet together. What beauty is ſtampt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face? What majeſty in the eye? What ſtrength is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the arms? What activity into the hands? What muſick and melody in the tongue? Nothing in this whole fabrique could be well left out or better placed, either for ornament, or for uſe. Some men make great houſes which have many ſpare rooms, or rooms ſeldom uſed; but as in this houſe there is not any one room wanting: ſo every room is of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all uſe.</p>
                     <p>Was ever clay thus honoured, thus faſhioned? <hi>Galen</hi> gave <hi>Epicurus</hi> an hundred years to imagine a more commodious ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, configuration or compoſition of any one part of the body; And ſurely if all the Angels in heaven had ſtudied to this day, they could not have caſt man into a more curious mould, or have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a fairer and more correct edition of him. <hi>This clay cannot ſay to him that faſhioneth it, What makest thou? Or this work, he hath no hands,</hi> (Iſa. 45.9.) The Lord hath made man ſo well, that man cannot tell which way to be made better; This work can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, He that wrought me had no hands, that is, I am ill wrought; as to ſay, you have no eyes, you have no ears, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of negligence and inadvertency, both in hearing and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So when we ſay to a man, Surely you have no hands, our meaning is, he hath done his work, either ſlothfully or unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. But this work of mans body ſhall not need to ſay unto God, he hath no hands, he hath given proof enough, that hands and head too were imploied about this work. Let us make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that we have hands and tongues, and hearts for him, that we have skin and fleſh, bones and ſinews for him, that we have ſtrength, and health, and life, and all for him; ſeeing all theſe are alſo derived from him, as appears in the next words, <hi>Thou hast granted me life and favour.</hi>

                        <hi>Job</hi> having thus deſcribed the naturall conception and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his body, deſcendeth to his quickning and preſervation. When God had formed man out of the duſt of the earth, he then breathed into him the breath of life, and man became a living ſoul; and thus when God hath formed man in the womb, given him skin and fleſh, bones and ſinews, then he gives life and breath and all things neceſſary, to the continuation of what he hath wrought up to ſuch excellent perfections. Our divine Philoſopher teacheth us this doctrine.</p>

Thou haſt not thrown or hudled my life into my body, Thou haſt put it in exquiſitely and orderly. The frame of the body is an exquiſite frame, but the frame, the faculties and powers, the actings and motions of the ſoul are farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. The inhabitant is more noble then the houſe, and the jewell then the cabinet. <hi>As the life is better then meat, and the body then</hi> (artificiall) <hi>raiment</hi> (Mat. 6.25.)

                     <p>Life is here put metonymically for the ſoul, of which it is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as the ſoul is often put for the life, whereof it is a cauſe.</p>
                     <p>We tranſlate in the ſingular number, <hi>life,</hi> the Hebrew is plurall, <hi>Thou haſt granted me lives.</hi> But hath a man more lives then one? Some underſtand <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaking not only of corporall, but ſpirituall life; as our naturall life is the ſalt of the body, to keep that from corrupting: ſo ſpirituall life, or the life of grace, is the ſalt of the ſoul, to keep that from corrupting.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Thou haſt granted me lives,</hi> that is, ſay others, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life and eternall life.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Lives</hi> may be taken for the three great powers of life.
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:51057:263"/> Man hath one life conſiſting of three diſtinct lives: For whereas there is a life of vegetation and growth, ſuch as is in trees and plants: and a life of ſenſe and motion, ſuch as is in beaſts of the earth, fowls of the air, and fiſhes of the ſea: And a life of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſuch as is in Angels, whereby they underſtand and diſcourſe; theſe three lives, which are divided and ſhared among all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther living creatures, are brought together and compacted into the life of man.

The civil godſhip of Kings and Magiſtrates appears much in this, that they can grant a forfeited life, either by reprieve for a time, or by pardon for ever. It is ordinary with men, to grant others leaſes for their lives, but they cannot grant them life.

For though (as that voice ſpake from heaven, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.13.) <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord,</hi> and though curſed are the living that live without the Lord: In which ſenſe the pooreſt
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:51057:265"/> dead dog is better then the proudeſt lion alive; Yet, conſider man only within the line and compaſſe of naturall life; Then he that lives in the worſt condition, is better then he that once was in higheſt dignity, but now is dead. It is uſuall in Scripture by a dogge to ſet forth the vileſt eſtate of man, and the moſt excellent by a lion. When <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> would ſhew how low he was in his own eyes, though the ſon of a noble Prince, he joyns theſe two, <hi>Dead and a dog together,</hi> 2 Sam. 9.8. <hi>What is thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that thou ſhouldſt look upon ſuch a dead dog as I am?</hi> He cals himſelf not only a dog, as Chriſt did the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and as ſhe acknowledged her ſelf to be, but to lay himſelf as low as lowneſſe it ſelf, he cals himſelf a <hi>dead dog,</hi> implying, That life gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſome honour, and caſteth a luſtre upon every ſubject, which it inhabits, though it be the meaneſt. When <hi>Eſau</hi> was near per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing with hunger (<hi>Gen.</hi> 25.32.) he reſolves thus, <hi>I am at the point to die, and what profit ſhall this birth-right do to me?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Shall I keep my birth-right, and loſe my life? My life is more precious. Thus he ſpake, and he ſpake profanely in it; yet there is ſome truth in what he ſpake; for if we take birth-right preciſely in the notion of a civil priviledge; ſo life is better then a birth-right; but he is called profane <hi>Eſau,</hi> becauſe there was a ſpirituall priviledge in his birth-right, which he ought to have va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued above his life. Any ſpirituall good thing is better then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall life, but life is the beſt of naturall, and better then all ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil good things. When the Prophet would expreſſe how great a bleſſing a King was to his people, he called him, <hi>The breath of their noſtrils,</hi> Lam. 4.29. and, <hi>live for ever,</hi> was the higheſt apprecation given the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kings. The moſt noble imitations of art are about this piece of nature; It is the ambition of a painter to draw to the life, or to ſhadow the motions and actings of life. When we would commend a picture, we ſay, It is done to the life; How precious a favour is reall life, the very ſhadow of which is of ſo great a price? He that laieth down his life, paieth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt debt, whether to juſtice or to nature. Chriſt went to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt price for, and ſhewed the greateſt favour to ſinners, when he parted with, and pawned this jewell for them, his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life.</p>

                     <p>Beſides, <hi>favour</hi> takes in not only thoſe outward comforts of health, ſtrength, liberty, plenty, but thoſe inward ornaments of life alſo; good education, and inſtruction in knowledge both hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and divine.

                     <p>Secondly, For the <hi>ſoul.</hi> Thus God preſerveth our ſpirits, while he keeps us from falling into, or from falling in temptation; while he keeps our corruptions from prevailing, and our graces from decaying.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The ſpirit of man is taken for his courage. Thus God preſerveth our ſpirits, while he keeps us from needleſſe fears, and cowardly deſpondencies. Doubtleſſe <hi>Iob</hi> had experience of the viſitation of God preſerving his ſpirit in all theſe ſenſes, yet here he ſeems chiefly to intend the preſervation of his life, which God had granted him with favour, or of thoſe comforts which were granted him with his life.</p>
                     <p>Hence obſerve. Firſt in generall,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That what God granteth, he preſerveth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="529" facs="tcp:51057:267"/>
                     <p>It is a part of his grant, that he will preſerve. Should the Lord beſtow the greateſt ſtock of mercy upon us, and leave us to the wide world, we ſhould quickly looſe all; God is not like the Carpenter or the Maſon, who buildeth up a houſe, and then leaveth it to it ſelf, or to the care of others. The Lord ſurveys what he builds, and keeps up what he ſets up; all would come down elſe. Providence ſucceedeth Creation, or Providence is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Creation. Aſſoon as ever the Lord had made man, and a garden, He took the man and put him into the Garden, which he had made, <hi>to dreſſe it, and to keep it</hi> (Gen. 2.15.) God putteth the creatures under mans charge, yet he keepeth all creatures in his own charge, and eſpecially man: A Garden without a man to viſit it would ſoon be a wilderneſſe. And man without God to viſit him, would ſoon be, or be in a wilderneſſe, either out of order, or in danger. <hi>Achiſh</hi> promiſeth <hi>David, I will make thee the keeper of my head for ever</hi> (1 Sam. 28.2.) His meaning was, he ſhould be <hi>Captain of his guard.</hi> Great Princes have their guards, they have keepers of their heads. The great King of heaven and earth is a guard to the meaneſt man, and the keeper of his head. God enquires of <hi>Cain</hi> for his brother <hi>Abel</hi> (Gen. 4.) <hi>Where is Abel thy brother?</hi> What is become of him? <hi>Cain</hi> was angry at the queſtion, <hi>Am I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my brothers keeper?</hi> We ought to be one anothers keepers; our mutuall viſitations ſhould preſerve one anothers ſpirits. Some are apt to think themſelves too good for the work: others, that the work is too hard for them. It is our comfort, and it may be our aſſurance, that God hath neither of theſe thoughts, <hi>The Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy ſhade up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy right hand. The Sunne ſhall not ſmite thee by day, nor the Moon by night. The Lord ſhall preſerve thee from all evil; He ſhall preſerve thy ſoul: The Lord ſhall preſerve thy going out and thy coming in, from this time forth and for evermore</hi> (Pſal. 121.5.) How large a writ or patent of protection is granted here? No time ſhall be hurtfull, neither <hi>day nor night;</hi> which include all times. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall hurt, neither Sunne nor Moon, nor heat nor cold. Theſe include all annoiances. Nothing ſhall be hurt, <hi>Thy ſoul ſhall be preſerved, thy out-goings and thy comings in ſhall be preſerved.</hi> Theſe include the whole perſon of man, and him in all his juſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and actions. Nothing of man is ſafe without a guard, and nothing of man can be unſafe, which is thus guarded. They ſhall be kept, who can ſay, <hi>The Lord is our keeper.</hi> And they cannot
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:51057:268"/> be kept, no not by legions of Angels, who have not the Lord for their keeper. None can keep us, but he, and he hath promiſed to keep us <hi>for evermore.</hi> Some men are weary of their offices, and ſome are put out of office;<note place="margin">Praefecturam ejus accipiat al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, id eſt, omnia quae in ejus cura ſunt quae ſub ſua poteſtate habet.</note> God is neither. In that Prophetical curſe againſt <hi>Iudas,</hi> tis ſaid, <hi>Let another take his office</hi> (Pſ. 109.8.) What of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? It is this word, and notes there the office of looking to, or of preſerving the ſouls of others, we commonly call it, <hi>The cure of ſouls.</hi> Such is the office of all the Miniſters of Chriſt, That's <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy by divine right;</hi> this in the text is <hi>divine Epiſcopacy.</hi> That word which here in <hi>Job</hi> we tranſlate <hi>viſitation,</hi> and in the Pſalm now cited, <hi>office,</hi> is called <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> by the Apoſtle (<hi>Act.</hi> 1.21.) Chriſt is the great Biſhop or viſitour both of our ſouls and bodies. He is the oecumenicall Biſhop. The whole world is his Dioceſſe, He preſerveth man and beaſt. See more of this point, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter 7.20.</p>
                     <p>Again, For as much as this viſitation which extendeth to the whole man, is here in the letter determined upon the ſpirit. We may obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Taking ſpirit for <hi>life,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That as our well-being, ſo our being in the world is at the daily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The living God not only giveth, but maintaineth our lives. We live not by bread, while we are healthy, nor by medicines, when we are ſick; but by the Word of God. His viſitation doth all.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Take <hi>spirit</hi> for the <hi>ſoul,</hi> then we are taught,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That our ſouls are not independently immortall or incorruptible.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the life of the whole man is not, ſo neither is the life of the ſoul, of, or in it ſelf, without ſupport from God. The Angelicall ſpirits who were never married to bodies of earth, ſtand not meerly by Creation, but by Providence. The viſitation of God preſerveth thoſe ſpirits, how much more the ſpirits of men, which are eſpouſed to duſt and clay.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As ſpirit ſignifieth the ſoul, not only in it's natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but in it's ſpirituall ſtate, or in the ſtate of grace, We learn,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That our ſpirituall ſtook and treaſure are in danger, and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, if the power and care of God did not preſerve our spirits.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Grace cannot keep it ſelf, if left to its ſelf. We ſhould looſe, not only degrees of grace, but all grace, were it left in our own
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:51057:268"/> hands. But becauſe it is grace, therefore it is not left in our own hands, and becauſe grace is not left in our own hands, therefore it cannot be loſt. So the Apoſtle clearly (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.) <hi>We are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation.</hi> The word ſignifies to keep, as a City beleaguered without by a ſtrong enemy, is kept by a Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon within. Man at the firſt had an excellent eſtate in ſpirituals; though it cannot be ſaid (properly) that he had grace (for that is in the hand of a Mediator) yet he had the image of God, and perfect innocency, but becauſe God did not viſit his ſpirit by freſh aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he was ſtript of all, and fell from the throne of his created glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As God viſits our ſouls by preventing grace, to give us what we had not: ſo he viſits us by his preſerving and perſevering grace, to continue what he hath given.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Foraſmuch as (though God createth and careth for the whole man, yet) the viſitation of God is expreſſed only, as to the ſpirit. We may obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That God doth chiefly take care of, and provide for the spirit or ſoul of man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When God formed the body of man at firſt, out of the duſt of the earth, and breathed into his noſtrils, the breath of life, it is not ſaid he became a living body, or a living man, <hi>But, man became a living ſoul.</hi> So here, the work of providence is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged to the whole man, but reſtrained to his ſpirit; As if the Lord did ſcarce thinke our bodies either worth, or needing a viſit in compariſon of our ſpirits. And ſeeing God cares for nothing in us, ſo much, as for our ſpirits, ſhould not our care be chiefly for our ſpirits? The ſoul is (upon the matter) all man, ought not man to be moſt of all for his ſoul? Shall the thoughts of God be moſt buſied, his care and inſpection moſt fixed upon our ſpirits, and ſhall not ours? While Chriſt in a manner diſchargeth us of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man (<hi>Mat.</hi> 6.25.) <hi>Take no thought for your life, what ye ſhall ear, or what ye ſhall drink, nor yet for your body, what ye ſhall put on,</hi> His meaning was, to charge us more deeply with the inward man; yet how many are there, whoſe outward man ſtands them in more coſt and care, in more thoughts and viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for one day, then their ſpirits or inward man doth for a whole year, yea, for their whole lives! Viſitations are frequent and ſerious for the preſerving of the body: but where ſhall we finde ſerious thoughts of viſiting the ſoul?</p>
                     <p>Take this word further, <hi>If it be the viſitation of God which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:51057:269"/> our ſpirits,</hi> we ſhould often viſit God with praier, intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to continue theſe viſitations. Praier is our viſiting God, as providence is Gods viſiting of us, &amp; we ſhould viſit God by praier, not only (as they, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.) in trouble, but in our peace: we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to viſit our eſtates, our families, but eſpecially our ſouls and ſpirits in their moſt flouriſhing condition. The Apoſtle uſeth it as an argument to keep us from diſtracting thoughts (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4.2.) <hi>Let your moderation be known unto all men, The Lord is at hand; be carefull in nothing, but in every thing by praier and ſupplication, let your requests be made known unto God.</hi> The Lord is at hand, let not your hearts be troubled. Viſit God in duty, who is at hand to viſit you in mercy. Though there be an infinite diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, yet God is not farre from any man, and he is ever near ſome men. Let not us be ſtrangers to God, when we hear he maketh continuall viſits to us. <hi>Thy viſitation doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my ſpirit.</hi>

Thou haſt held out mercy in thine hand, but ſomewhat elſe lay in thine heart.</hi> This interpretation, in the common underſtanding of it, is moſt unworthy of God. It is the wickedneſſe of men to ſpeak fair, and to doe ſome courteſies, while cruelty and revenges are hid in their hearts. When <hi>Eſau (Gen.</hi> 27.41.) ſaw himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated of the bleſſing by his brother, <hi>He ſaid in his heart, The daies of mourning for my father are at hand, then will I ſlay my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iacob:</hi> Here's the character of malice, he gave neither bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor mother ill language, but <hi>he ſaid in his heart.</hi> The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God never ſpeaks good to them, to whom he intends e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. The Creatour needs not daub or pervaricate with his creatures.</p>
                     <p>I grant indeed that the Lord giveth wicked men many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward favours, and ſpeaks them fair in his works, but he never ſpeaks them fair in his Word, <hi>Say, Woe to the wicked, it ſhall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands ſhall be given him</hi> (Iſa. 3.11.) Men are apt to flatter, but flattery is much an abomination to the Lord, as it is below him.</p>
                     <p>I grant alſo, That the Lord giveth his own people many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and ſpeaketh reall kindeneſſes to them, while he hides af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction in his heart. What evil ſoever he brings upon them, he hath thoughts to do them good, and hath nothing but good for them in his thoughts.</p>
                     <p>We underſtand by thoſe <hi>hidden things,</hi> the mercies which <hi>Iob</hi> with his laſt breath had enumerated: then the words import two things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, An argument to move the Lord not to deſtroy him, or or to aſſure his own heart that he would not. As if he had ſaid, Lord, I know thou remembreſt well, what thou haſt done for me, what coſt thou haſt been at in making me at firſt, and in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me hitherto; ſurely then thou wilt not pull all down in a moment.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The words may import that the Lord in afflicting <hi>Job</hi> had uſed only a kinde of ſacred diſſimulation. A diſſembler car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth himſelf, as if he had no intent to do what he is reſolved to do; It is uſuall with men thus to diſſemble hatred, and ſo have
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:51057:270"/> ſome their love. He that purpoſeth much good to another, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it ſometimes under ſowre language and unkindeſt uſage. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had moſt endeared affection toward his brethren, yet he put a diſguiſe of anger upon it, acting the part of a ſevere man, who lieth at catch to finde out advantages and pick quarrels. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> uſed many ſtratagems of love, to entangle his brethren, and wrapt up his good will, in hard ſpeeches and rough carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: Nothing appearing leſſe then what indeed he moſt was, <hi>A loving brother, forgetfull of nothing but injuries; Job</hi> ſeems to have had ſuch a conception of God, while he ſaith, <hi>Theſe things hast thou hid in thine heart;</hi> And then his ſenſe riſeth thus, <hi>Lord, I know thou beareſt favour and good will towards me ſtill. The fire of thy love is not extinct but covered. Thou doſt but perſonate an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, thou art my friend: thou draweſt a cloud betwixt me and the light of thy countenance, but thy countenance is ſtill as full of light towards me as ever, and though I ſee nothing but ſorrows on every ſide, yet I know mercies are hid in thine heart.</hi> Thus the words are an aſſertion of <hi>Jobs</hi> faith and aſſurance, that God loved him, while his chaſtnings lay moſt heavy upon him. Hence obſerve, Firſt,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Saints while they are ſtrong in faith, are able to diſcern the favour of God through the clouds and coverings of his moſt angry dispenſations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This they can do, and when they can, they are arrived at a great height in grace. To maintain our intereſt in Chriſt through diſadvantages, is ſtrong faith. The woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> (Mat. 15.26.) knew her pardon and acceptance were hid in the heart of Chriſt, while he called her dog, and would ſcarce vouchſafe to caſt an eye upon her. Faith did this, and faith can do the like at this day. But every true faith will not do it. There is a kinde of miracle wrought in ſuch believing: So Chriſt concludes with that woman (<hi>ver.</hi> 28.) <hi>O woman great is thy faith.</hi> Truth of grace is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for every work of grace: ſome works will not be done without ſtrength, as well as truth. Weak faith is ready to ſay, Mercy is loſt, when it is but hidden, and that God means us no good, when we doe not enjoy good. But the ſtrong faith ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on this wiſe; <hi>Lord, I know there is mercy in thine heart towards me, though I ſee nothing in thy face but frowns, and feel nothing from thy hand but blows. Let God do what he pleaſeth with me, I will not have a jealous thought of him, or ſuſpect his intentions towards
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:51057:270"/> me, whatſoever his actions be.</hi> Secondly, obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>We may gather arguments of ſupport in our greateſt ſufferings from the apprehenſion of concealed mercies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The skill and holy ſubtilty of faith can winde it ſelf in Gods bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and from what it findes lying ſecretly there for us, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages us to bear what is openly laid upon us.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Obſerve, <hi>A believer looks upon all his receits, as coming out of the heart of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As he can look into his own heart, and ſee all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and revealed counſels of God hidden there, ſo he can look into the heart of God, and ſee all the comforts he wanteth hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den there. Men of the world, take their comforts only from the hand of God, Saints take theirs from the heart of God. It put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the price upon every bleſſing, when we can look upon ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall love, as the ſpring of it. Look how much of the heart of our friend we can ſee in a courteſie, ſo much true value there is in it. Hence it is uſuall with man, when he would expreſſe his freeneſſe to thoſe who deſire a favour at his hands, to ſay, Yes, <hi>Take it with heart and good will, you have it with all my heart:</hi> We reade of one, who complained he had received but a golden cup, when he ſaw another receive a kiſſe from a noble Prince. A kiſſe is a better gift then a cup of gold. Love is the richeſt preſent. How happy then are they, who have the golden cup, and a kiſſe too? much from the hand, and all from the heart, from the love of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> having thus reviſed and read over the particular of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer mercies received from the bounty and free love of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives his complaint about, and renews his deſire of deliverance from preſent ſorrows in his next addreſſe to God.</p>

                  <p>THe connection of theſe words lieth ſomewhat in the dark, and this inevidence hath cauſed divers conjectures about it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some make the connection with the 13. verſe, <hi>I know</hi> (ſaid <hi>Job) that this is with thee;</hi> and here he declareth what was with him, namely, that, <hi>If I ſinne, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The connection is made by others with the 12. verſe, <hi>Thou haſt granted me life and favour, and thy viſitation hath preſerved my ſpirit, yet if I ſin, thou markest me,</hi> &amp;c. As if <hi>Job</hi> had ſaid, Though thou haſt been pleaſed to make ſo many grants of favour, and haſt done all thoſe things for me, which were hidden in thine heart, yet I know thou wilt not bear with, or connive at me, <hi>If I ſinne againſt thee:</hi> Thou haſt not given me theſe mercies, that I ſhould be imboldened to tranſgreſſe the rule of thy juſtice; no, though thou haſt done much for me, <hi>Yet if I ſin, thou markeſt me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third goeth higher, and makes theſe words depend upon the third verſe, where <hi>Job</hi> puts three Queries to God; the laſt of which is, <hi>Is it good unto thee that thou ſhouldeſt ſhine upon the counſel of the wicked?</hi> I know it is not, for ('tis like I might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape as well as another, yet) <hi>If I ſinne, thou markeſt me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity; If I be wicked, woe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</hi> Mine own experience proves thee farre enough from ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the counſell of the wicked.

                           <gap reason="foreign">

                        </note> which occaſion as many different interpretations of the text:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, To preſerve, and that two wales; firſt, by protecting from thoſe evils which others would bring upon us (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.9.) <hi>Keep me from the ſnare which they have laid.</hi> That is, Protect me from the danger which their ſnares threaten me with. So at the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe of this Chapter, <hi>Thy viſitation doth preſerve my spirit.</hi> Secondly, It is rendered to preſerve by <hi>sparing,</hi> or not bringing thoſe evils upon us, which our own ſins have deſerved. So the Vulgar here, who to make out his ſenſe,<note place="margin">Si peccavi &amp; ad horam peper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſti mihi, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Vulg.</note> puts the later part into the form of an interrogation, <hi>If I have ſinned, and thou haſt spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me for a time, Wherefore then doſt thou not acquit me from mine iniquity?</hi> As if the meaning of <hi>Job</hi> were this. When in former times I ſinned againſt thee, thou waſt pleaſed to remit of thy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, and deal gently with me, <hi>Thou didſt spare me, as a father spareth a ſonne that ſerveth him.</hi> Why is the tenour of thy diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations ſo much changed from what it was, ſeeing thou art a God, that changeſt not, and I am but what I was, a weak and changeable man? Why am I now charged with ſinne, and not ſet free as ſometimes (I have been) from ſorrow, the fruit of it? Wilt thou deal with me, who ſinne out of infirmity, or againſt my will, as with thoſe who are wicked, and have a will to ſin?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, To prevent others from doing what they deſire, or our ſelves from what we fear (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23.) <hi>I was upright before him, and I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity;</hi> As if he had ſaid, I have maintained ſuch a ſtrict watch over my own heart, that I
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:51057:272"/> have prevented my ſelf from falling into that ſin which I was moſt ſubject to, and in danger of, both in regard of my conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and temptation, Taking this meaning of the word, the whole verſe is rendered thus, <hi>If, or, when I am ready to ſinne, thou (ſtoppeſt or) preventeſt me, Why then doſt thou not acquit me from mine iniquity?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Lord, wilt thou deal with me, as with a wicked man? Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked, for by thy preventing grace, thou haſt kept me from all wickednes, and ſtopt me from many ſins.</p>
                     <p>Whence note,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the remembrance of the power of God in keeping us pure from greater ſins, is an argument that he will ſpare us, though we have (through infirmity) fallen into ſin,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He that holds us from iniquity, will not deſtroy us for iniquity. Some are ſtopt from ſinne, and ſtorm when they are ſtopt, theſe have no reaſon to think, God will ſpare them, becauſe he hath ſtopt them. Thouſands are ſtopt from ſin, who neither know what it is to ſinne, nor that they have been ſtopt from ſinne. Theſe cannot plead this point: As it is no vertue to endure what is not grievous to us: ſo no grace not to do what is not joyous to us, when we do it. But to know we are ſtopt from a pleaſing ſin, and rejoyce at it, to ſee how our corruptions have been prevented, and to bleſſe God for it; this is a great degree of grace. As there is a preventing grace, which beginneth with us, while we are ſtrangers from God, and are walking on in the waies of ſin; ſo there is a preventing grace, watching over us after we are turned to God, leſt we fall into ſin. Experience of this may be a ſweet ſupport unto the ſoul, under the ſaddeſt afflictions, and in the darkeſt night of ſpirituall deſertions.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The word ſignifieth to keep in priſon, or in ſafe cuſtody. The Noun is a priſon in Hebrew. And thus the ſenſe is given three waies, as an Aſſertion, as an Interrogation, as an Imprecation. Firſt, as an Aſſertion, <hi>If I have ſinned, thou wilt, or thou maieſt impriſon me, and not acquit me from mine iniquity.</hi> Whence note,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the beſt and deareſt of Gods ſervants may look for ſtraits, if they walk looſly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Lord will ſhut them up, if they preſume and take undue liberty, or grow licentious. They ſhall be either humbled or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, who turn the grace of God (that is, the manifeſtation
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:51057:272"/> of his grace, either by his word or by his works) into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. God will not cocker his own children, and dandle them ſo, as to forget to correct them, if they forget him and their own duty. If <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſin, <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall ſmart for it; and if <hi>Iob</hi> ſinne, <hi>Iob</hi> muſt look to be laid in priſon for it. Thus he ſpeaks, acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God from ſhining upon the counſels of wicked men, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he will not ſpare, no not his own children, if they ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The ſenſe is given by an Interrogation, <hi>If I ſinne,</hi>

Wilt thou not acquit me from mine iniquity?</hi> And ſo he pleadeth with God, as uſing too much ſeverity and harſhneſſe againſt him, <hi>What, ſhall I be laid by the heels for every fault?

Where are thy compaſſions, and the ſounding of thy bowels? are they reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? It ſhould ſeem ſo, elſe thou wouldeſt not thus reſtrain and impriſon me.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As an Imprecation, <hi>If I have ſinned, according as I am charged, impriſon me as long as thou wilt, and do not acquit me from mine iniquity:</hi> If I am ſuch a man as my friends judge me to be, I expect no favour; let me be poor and ſick ſtill, torture me, rack me, do what thou wilt with me. Like that of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 7.4, 5. <hi>If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let the enemy perſecute my ſoul and take it, yea let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the duſt.</hi> I ask no favour, if I am ſuch a man as mine enemies have repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me: or if I have done that for which they challenge me.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, To obſerve and mark: and it importeth a criticall, a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious obſervation; to mark exactly (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3.) <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhouldſt mark iniquity, who ſhall ſtand?</hi> But doth not the Lord mark iniquity? Doth not he take notice of every ſin acted by any of the children of men, eſpecially by his own children? Why then doth the Pſalmiſt put it upon an <hi>If?</hi> If thou, Lord, ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mark iniquity. 'Tis true, the Lord marks all iniquity to know it, but he doth not mark any iniquity in his children to condemn them for it: So the meaning of the Pſalm is, <hi>That if the Lord ſhould mark ſinne,</hi> with a ſtrict and ſevere eye, as a Judge to charge it upon the perſon ſinning, no man could bear it.

                     <p>Whence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That God takes notice of the ſinnes and failings of his owne people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If I ſin, then thou markeſt me; and in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, verſe 16. <hi>Thou numbreſt my ſteps, doſt thou not watch over my ſin?</hi> Thou numbreſt my ſteps, What ſteps? He meaneth not the ſteps of his outward, but of his inward man: or the ſteps of his outward man in order to the inward. There is a morall walking, <hi>Walk before me, and be upright:</hi> walking is converſing or acting: ſo, <hi>Thou numbreſt my ſteps,</hi> thou telleſt my morall motions, the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of my ſoul and body, what I do, and what I think, <hi>Doſt thou not watch over my ſinne?</hi> And again (<hi>Chap.</hi> 31.4.) <hi>Doth not he ſee my waies, and count all my ſteps?</hi> That is, how my converſation is ordered, both toward himſelf, and toward my neighbour? Thus the Lord counteth all our ſteps, we cannot ſtep aſide or tread awry, but he obſerves us. There are two that keep a record of our lives.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, God, he followeth us up and down, as with pen, ink, and paper to write our actings.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Our own conſciences (which are as God within us) keep a record too, they write our lives, and count our ſteps. Many cannot read the book of conſcience, and ſo know little that is in it: But a time will come (if conſcience be not purged by the bloud of Chriſt) when they ſhall perfectly read all their ſins in the book of conſcience. And if conſcience, which is Gods deputy, then, much more God, who is the Judge of conſcience marketh us if we ſin. God needs not judge upon information, but upon his own obſervation. He will reprove every man whom he doth not pardon: And is able to ſet before us in order, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever any of us have done. How then do ſome ſay, <hi>That God ſees not ſinne in his children? Job</hi> ſaith, That God marked his ſinne; but according to this doctrine, he ſhould rather have ſaid, <hi>If I ſin, thou doſt not mark me.</hi> Some through ignorance ſin, and ſee it not, ſin and perceive it not; but no man (among all the multitudes of men) can ſin unſeen, or unperceived by God. <hi>If I ſin, then thou mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt me.</hi>

                     <p>Firſt, That <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaks from his unbelief, as if he could not ſee pardon through the thick cloud of his troubles, or have any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that God had mercy in ſtore for him, while he endured ſuch plenty of miſeries.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That he ſpeaks thus, upon a ſuppoſition of impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency; As if he had ſaid, If I ſinne and humble not my ſelf, thou wilt not acquit me.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That by <hi>iniquity</hi> he means his affliction, putting the cauſe for the effect: So, <hi>Thou wilt not acquit me for mine iniquity,</hi> is, Thou wilt not take away theſe afflictions, which are counted as the <hi>proceed or iſſue</hi> of mine iniquity.</p>
                     <p>Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Sinne is a debt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Every acquittance ſuppoſeth an obligation. All men, as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are in a debt of duty to God, and when they fail in that, they are in a debt of penalty, as ſinners.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve, ſecondly,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When ſinne is pardoned, the ſinner is acquitted, his debt is taken off, and his bonds are cancelled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Pardon is our diſcharge, our <hi>quietus eſt,</hi> ſealed in the bloud of Chriſt. All proceſſe at law, or from the law, is then prohibited: there's no more to be ſaid, or done againſt us.</p>
                     <p>Again, The word ſignifies to cleanſe and purge, as well as to acquit; Note from it,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That as ſinne defileth the ſoul, ſo pardon cleanſeth it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Purge me with hyſſop, and I ſhall be clean; waſh me, and I ſhall be whiter then ſnow,</hi> was <hi>Davids</hi> prayer for pardon after his great defilement, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.1, 7. <hi>If we confeſſe our ſins, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſinnes, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Foraſmuch as <hi>Iob</hi> groaning under burdens of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſpeaks ſo often about the pardon of ſin, we learn,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That while ſinne remaineth (to our ſenſe) unpardoned, the

                     </p>
                     <p>The removing of affliction is a ſign that ſinne is forgiven, and the ſenſe of our forgivenes, is an argument that affliction ſhall be removed.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Taking the former words in conjunction with theſe, <hi>If I ſinne</hi> (knowingly and wickedly, as they charge me) <hi>Thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</hi> Obſerve,</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>There is abundant mercy for returning ſinners, but I know of none for thoſe that reſolve to go on in ſin. There is a promiſe of repentance, and a promiſe to repentance, but there is no promiſe which doth not either offer or require repentance, <hi>Repent and thou ſhalt be ſaved</hi> is the tenour of the Goſpel, as well as <hi>beleeve and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Though many who are going on in their ſins, are overtaken by grace, yet there is no grace promiſed to thoſe who go on in their ſins. The holieſt are threatned with wrath, if they doe; ſurely then, none are put into an expectation of mercy, if they do. The promiſes either finde us repenting, or they cauſe us to repent. No ſinner is pardoned for repentance, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaks that language more clearly in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which ſome make an expoſition of theſe.</p>

                        </note>The word is derived (ſaith one of the Rabbins) from a root ſignifying to <hi>houl:</hi> Great mourning is a kinde of houling; and they who are in woe, are bid to houl (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.6. <hi>chap.</hi> 23.1, &amp;c.) Wicked men houl rather then pray in their diſtreſſe, becauſe of their extream worldly woe, <hi>They have not cried unto me with their hearts, when they houled upon their beds,</hi> Hoſ. 7.14.</p>
                     <p>There are legall woes, and there are evangelicall woes. The Law cries woe, and ſo doth the Goſpel: Goſpel woes are the worſer of the two; For if the Law ſay woe to us, the Goſpel may ſay mercy to us; but if the Goſpel ſay, woe to us (as it doth to hypocrites, who abuſe, and to unbelievers, who refuſe
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:51057:274"/> mercy) where ſhall we have mercy? All woes may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in this place, Law woes and Goſpel woes, temporall woes and eternall woes, <hi>If I be wicked, then woe unto me.</hi> Hence obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Woe is the portion of wicked men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though they laugh, yet woe is their portion, yea they are therefore threatned with woe, becauſe they laugh (<hi>Luk.</hi> 6.25.) <hi>Woe unto you that laugh now, for ye ſhall mourn and weep.</hi> Some wicked men are as merry, as if mercy were their peculiar. But we may ſay to their mirth, What doth it? Or if we ſhould ask them, What they do to make themſelves ſo merry: <hi>David</hi> will reſolve us what their courſe is (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.2.) <hi>The wicked flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf in his own eyes, untill his iniquity be found to be hatefull.</hi> He that would be flattered, ſhall never want a flatterer, for if none will do it, he will doe it himſelf. He ſpeaks well of himſelf, and therefore he thinks all's well. But uſually he hath ſome others ready enough to ſpeak well of him too. The true Prophets com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the falſe for <hi>crying peace, peace, when there was no peace,</hi> for ſaying all is well, when they ſhould ſay all is woe. But though wicked men flatter themſelves, and though they get their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to flatter them, yea though Miniſters flatter them, yet God will not flatter them; and at laſt their own conſciences will not flatter them neither. Conſcience will preach them a Sermon of woes at laſt, though poſſibly it hath been ſilent through ignorance, or ſilenc'd through malice for a long time.</p>
                     <p>As all the promiſes of grace and mercy, hang over the heads of the godly and ſincere; which way ſoever they go, a cloud of bleſſings drops and diſtils upon them: So clouds of wrath and bloud hang over the heads of wicked men, dropping upon them, yea dropping upon them when they ſuppoſe the Sunne ſhineth upon them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Conſider who ſpeaks this; <hi>If I</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob) be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, then woe unto me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence obſerve, That</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A godly man may put the worſt caſes to himſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Scripture puts ſuch caſes to godly men, therefore they may put ſuch to themſelves (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13.) <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, writing to the Saints. Though ſuch a ſuppoſition cannot be reſolved into this poſition, <hi>A godly man
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:51057:275"/> ſhall die,</hi> yet the ſuppoſition is true, If he liveth after the fleſh he ſhall die. So the Apoſtle of himſelf, and his fellow-Apoſtles, yea of the Angels. <hi>If we or an Angel from heaven, preach any other Goſpel unto you, then that which we have preached, let him be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> (Gal. 1.9,) And as <hi>Paul</hi> prophecied a curſe upon any, either Apoſtle or angel, who ſhould preach a falſe Goſpel, ſo a <hi>woe</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, if he ſhould neglect to preach the true Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.16. They who are above all curſes, may be threatned with a curſe. And they who ſhall certainly be preſerved from doing that which inevitably brings the curſe, may be told of a curſe in caſe they ſhould do it.</p>
                     <p>They put dangerous ſuppoſitions oppoſite to theſe, who ſay, <hi>Let a godly man be never ſo wicked, yet it ſhall be well with him; let him ſinne as much as he will, yet it ſhall be well with him.</hi> The Spirit of God never puts ſuch ſuppoſitions. As the Scripture ſpeaks of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to perſwade; ſo ſometimes to terrifie the godly from ſinne, but never a tittle which may be an encouragement to ſin. It ſpeaks much to keep up their hearts in an aſſurance of pardon, in caſe they fall into ſin, and much more to keep down their corruptions, and to preſerve them from falling into ſin. Though there be a truth in it, that how much ſo ever a godly man ſinneth, he ſhall be pardoned; yet the Scripture uſeth no ſuch language, and the form of wholſom words teacheth every man rather to ſpeak thus, <hi>If I be wicked, then woe unto me,</hi>
                        <q>If I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe words ſtand in an elegant oppoſition againſt the former. Here are perſons and ſtates oppoſite: perſons, <hi>The wicked and the righteous, If I be wicked, if I be righteous:</hi> ſtates, <hi>Woe, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the head, If I be wicked, then woe unto me; If I be righteous, then will I not lift up mine head.</hi> He doth not ſay, If I be righteous I ſhall be happy, though that be a truth, but (which was more ſutable to his purpoſe) <hi>If I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some put this into a <hi>dilemma,</hi> or double argument, by which <hi>Iob</hi> would aggravate the greatneſſe of his affliction; As if he had ſaid, <hi>Let me look which way I will, my caſe is very ſaid, if I be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked then woe be to me; If I be righteous, yet I am ſo full of ſorrows, that I am not able to hold up my head;</hi> But I rather interpret this later part of the verſe, as a deſcription of <hi>Jobs</hi> humility, in the beſt of
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:51057:275"/> his ſpirituall eſtate then as any aggravation of the ilnes of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eſtate.</p>
                     <q>If I be righteous.</q>
                     <p>He ſpeaks not as if he doubted whether he were righteous or no. <hi>Iob</hi> had ſhewed the ſetledneſſe of his ſpirit in that aſſurance more then once before, but he puts the beſt of his caſe to ſhew how low he was in his own thoughts, when he was at beſt. There is a two-fold righteouſneſſe; Firſt, of Juſtification. Secondly, of Sanctification, of ſincerity or uprightneſſe: and ſo his meaning is, Suppoſe I am ſuch, as I have aſſerted my ſelf to be, and as God himſelf hath teſtified me to be, perfect and upright, yet <hi>I will not lift up my head;</hi> Some read I cannot, others, I dare not lift up my head.</p>
                     <q>I will not lift up my head.</q>
                     <p>Not lift up thy head, <hi>man,</hi> if thou wert righteous? Why, who in the world ſhall lift up their heads, if the righteous ſhall not? Are there any that have ſuch cauſe to lift up their heads as they? He might ſay indeed, If I were rich, or if I were honourable, yet I will not lift up my head, theſe are things which cannot, and therefore ſhould not lift up any mans ſpirit an inch from the ground: but to ſay, If I were righteous, I would not lift up my head, ſeems a degradation or an abaſement of righteouſneſſe. To clear this I ſhall open the phraſe a little.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To lift up the head</hi> of another man, is to advance him. Thus <hi>Pharaoh lifted up the head of his chief Butler,</hi> Gen. 40.13. And the King of <hi>Babylon lifted up the head of Iehojakin King of Iudah, and brought him forth out of priſon.</hi> Jer. 52.21. In this ſenſe <hi>David</hi> cals God, <hi>The lifter up of his head,</hi> Pſ. 3.3.</p>
                     <p>To lift up our own heads, is to prevail, and to get above preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing evils victoriouſly, Judg. 8.28. <hi>Thus was Midian ſubdued before the children of Iſrael, ſo that they lifted up their heads no more:</hi> That is, <hi>Gideon</hi> routed and made ſo compleat a conqueſt over the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites,</hi> that they were totally broken, and could no more inſult over <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The victory of Chriſt over all our ſpirituall enemies, is thus deſcribed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.7. <hi>He ſhall drink of the brook in the way;</hi> that is, of the waters of affliction and ſorrow, which either the wrath of God, or the rage of men gave him to drink, while he was in the way of perfecting the work of our redemption; and
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:51057:276"/> becauſe he ſhall do this, <hi>Therefore ſhall be lift up his head,</hi> that is, he ſhall prevail by his paſſion, and overcome by dying, yea, he ſhall overcome death by a triumphant reſurrection.</p>

                        </note>Again, There is a two-fold lifting up of the head; Firſt, a lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the head with joy and conſolation (<hi>Luk.</hi> 21.28.) Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, A lifting up of the head with pride and oſtentation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.2. <hi>Loe thine enemies make a tumult, and they that hate thee have lift up the head;</hi> that is, they have proudly boaſted and vaunted themſelves. The later is <hi>Jobs</hi> ſenſe, <hi>If I be righteous, I will not lift up my head</hi> in pride, he might and he did lift up his head in joy, becauſe he knew himſelf righteous.</p>
                     <p>Once more, There is a lifting up of our heads in our ſelves, and a lifting up of our heads in Chriſt. <hi>Job</hi> diſclaims the former here, but he all along aſſumes the later. We cannot lift up our heads too high, in the thoughts of free grace, nor hang them down too low, in the thought of our own works.</p>

This of <hi>Job, I will not lift up my head,</hi> fals in ſenſe below his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, for his meaning is, I will abaſe my ſelf before God, I will be ſo farre from priding my ſelf, or walking (as the daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are deſcribed by the Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 3.16.) with a <hi>ſtretched forth necke;</hi> that I will rather hang downe my head.</p>

                        </note>To hang or hold down the head, in Scripture noteth humbling and ſorrow; when Chriſt bids his people lift up their heads with joy, becauſe the time of their redemption was drawing nigh, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that their heads would hang down with ſorrow, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>le that redemption was further off. The Jewiſh faſts are deſcribed (in part) by this poſture of ſorrow (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.5.) <hi>Is it ſuch a fast that I have choſen? A day for a man to afflict his ſoul? Is it to bow down his head as a bull-ruſh?</hi> Times of faſting are times of mourning, and then (it ſeems) they uſed to hang down the head, as a ſign of mourning.</p>
                     <p>Hence obſerve. <hi>That a godly man how upright and holy ſoever he is, walks humbly with God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="547" facs="tcp:51057:276"/>
                     <p>The more holineſſe any ſoul hath, the more humility it hath. Humility is a great part of our holineſſe; much more then is it an argument of holineſſe. The Phariſee (<hi>Luk.</hi> 18.) who thought that he was righteous, lifted up his head full high, he would not loſe an inch of his commendation, and therefore commends him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He is his own reporter of what he had done, and who he was; but the poor Publican durſt not lift up his eyes to heaven, his ſpirit hung down as well as his head, yet he was the righteous man, and went home juſtified rather then the other. It is the ſcope and deſign of the Goſpel to make and keep us humble. God hath ſet up the way of ſaving us by faith, that he might take away boaſting, and that no fleſh might glory in his ſight.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If <hi>Job</hi> would not lift up his head, though righteous, what ſhall we judge of thoſe, who lift up and carry their heads ſo high, though they are wicked? There is no reaſon any man ſhould be proud of his goodnes, what a madnes then is it for wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men to be proud of, or in their naughtines!</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Though <hi>Job</hi> was very thankfull for, and joyfull in, yet he durſt not lift up his head, or be proud of the white robes and coſtly raiment of imputed righteouſneſſe. What then ſhall we ſay of them, who are proud of the dirty rags and filthy raiment of their own inherent righteouſneſſe? A godly man walketh trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blingly, leſt he ſhould offend, therefore he ſaith, <hi>If I am wicked, woe unto me:</hi> and he walketh humbly, when he doth not offend, therefore he ſaith, though I am righteous, yet I will not hold up my head. <hi>Job</hi> hath often breathed out the humility of his ſoul in former paſſages, therefore I ſhall not inſiſt upon it here.<note place="margin">Saturitas haec respicit animae ventriculum, qui tantam aerum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum copiam vix potuit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coquere <hi>Pined.</hi>

Or from that reproach which his afflictions caſt upon him. Poverty is no ſhame to a beggar, who was born poor, but poverty is a ſhame to a man who hath been rich, and lived in honour. The originall word holds this forth moſt properly, being oppoſed to that which ſignifies weightineſſe and honour, becauſe honour is a weighty thing, as this ſignifies lightneſſe and ſhame, becauſe ſhame is a light thing, or a thing of nought.</p>

                     <p>The Vulgar takes it in that ill ſenſe, as noting pride and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſſe, tranſlating by the Noun, thus, <hi>For pride thou doſt catch me as a lion:</hi> or thou doſt <hi>hunt me as a lion, becauſe I am proud.</hi> A lion is a ſtout creature, and may be an embleme of pride.</p>
                     <p>Another gives a ſenſe near that. <hi>When it lifteth up it ſelf, then thou hunteſt me as a fierce lion.</hi> When what lifteth up it ſelf? when my head lifteth up it ſelf; he had ſaid in the former verſe, <hi>If I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head, for, if I doe lift up my head in pride, then thou wilt hunt me as a fierce lion;</hi> I ſhall be ſure
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:51057:279"/> to ſmart for every proud thought and high imagination. Both theſe tranſlations render the meaning of <hi>Iob</hi> thus, <hi>If I ſhould plead my own righteouſneſſe and innocency before thee, as thinking therein to lift up my head, and ſo ſhould wax confident in my ſelf, I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently pay for it, for I perceive that thou art preparing thine inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt me, as men doe against fierce lions, and wilde ſavage beaſts, to hunt, catch and deſtroy me.</hi> Here is a truth in <hi>theſi, God doth reſiſt the proud;</hi> if any head lifteth it ſelf up againſt God, God can quickly lay ſuch an head as low as the ground.

                     <p>A third tranſlation puts it by an Interrogation, <hi>I am full of confuſion, ſee thou mine affliction, Can it be lifted up?</hi> That is, Can my head be lifted up, when I am ſo full of ſorrow and confuſion? whatſoever my righteouſneſſe is, I am not in caſe now to ſtand upon it, 'tis no time for me to talk great words; Can I lift up mine head when thou preſſeſt me with ſuch a weight of affliction? <hi>Great afflictions will keep down the greateſt ſpirits, or break them down.</hi> Affliction will make the ſtouteſt heart ſtoop, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt head to bow.</p>
                     <p>But take the word according to our reading, as it referreth to his afflictions; <hi>it encreaſeth,</hi> that is, my affliction encreaſeth, and ſo a double expoſition is given.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, As if <hi>Iob</hi> had ſpoken his wiſh or his deſire, <hi>I am</hi> (ſaid he before) <hi>full of confuſion, ſee thou mine affliction, O that mine affliction might encreaſe, and that I might be fuller of confuſion! O that my troubles might be ſtrengthened upon me, and that I might be weak enough to ſee an end of my troubles, I am yet too ſtrong for death, O that thou wouldeſt quickly diſpatch me, more weight, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wounds, harder blows would be welcome.</hi> As if here again <hi>Iob</hi> had aſſumed and renewed that complaining deſire mentioned (<hi>Chap.</hi> 6.7, 8.) <hi>O that I might have my requeſt! and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</hi> (What was that?) <hi>Even that it would pleaſe God to deſtroy me, that he would let looſe his hand, and cut me off!</hi> But I ſhall let this paſſe; <hi>Iob</hi> hath ſpoken theſe wiſhes plainly, and in the letter too often; I will not charge him with another from a queſtionable interpretation.</p>
                     <p>Rather take the words declaratively, not for a wiſh of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er future afflictions, but for a manifeſtation of the greatneſſe of his preſent afflictions: ſo we expreſſe them, <hi>I am full of confuſion,

We know not the beginning of them, neither do we know when they will end. Now as the Lord afflicteth ſome ſeven times more for the puniſhment of their ſins, ſo others ſeven times more for the triall of their graces: Sufferings are ſent in perfection, to make us more perfect thorow ſufferings; Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſwell vvith pride, to abate the ſwellings of our pride, or to ſhew how thoſe ſwellings are abated into humility.

                     <p>I rather expound him in a third ſenſe, that the compariſon is made between God and the lion; <hi>Thou, O God, like a lion, doſt hunt me,</hi> Conſent of Scripture is cleareſt for this interpretation, which often repreſents God in afflicting his people under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a lion, as will appear in the proof of the obſervation ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from it; which is,</p>

(Mans acting of beaſtly luſts, is all the metamorphoſis or change of men into beaſts, which Heathen Poets have ſo much fancied, or the holy Scriptures ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.) Now, I ſay, as man acting cruelly upon man, is called a lion, ſo alſo is God.

Thus he debates, by and by he votes and reſolves negatively, <hi>I will not execute the fierceneſſe of mine anger: I will not return to deſtroy Ephraim, for I am God, and not man.</hi> But when he would ſhew the higheſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his wrath, then he denies to ſhew himſelf ſo much as man:
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:51057:281"/> Thus old <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Chaldea</hi> are terrified, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.1.) <hi>Come down and ſit in the duſt, O virgin daughter of Babylon,</hi> &amp;c.

Thus the Lord met with that literall <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſo at laſt he will meet with <hi>myſticall Babylon.</hi> And as he will be to all his proud enemies, a deſtroying and devouring lion: ſo he appeareth often to his own people; he ſaith even to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and to <hi>Zion,</hi> I will not meet you as a man, when <hi>you are carnall and walk as men.</hi> The uſuall dealings of God with his people are full of compaſſion, <hi>In meaſure (peck-peck) when it ſhooteth (or when thou ſendeſt it) forth, thou wilt debate with it, He ſtaieth his rough winde in the day of the Eaſt-winde</hi> (Iſa. 27.8.) He will not bluſter againſt, and ſtorm his people, when their enemies ſtorm againſt them; he alſo meaſures out their afflictions, and marks what is fit and proportionate to their ſtrength, and for their good, as a Phyſitian meaſures and weighs all the ingredients, which he mingles in a potion for his ſick patient: ſo the next words inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, <hi>By this therefore ſhall the iniquity of Iacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his ſinne.</hi> Yet at another time he afflicteth without meaſure, as if he intended to kill rather then to cure, and to take away their lives, rather then to take away their ſins. I grant his greateſt afflictions are as exactly meaſured and weighed as the leaſt. God knows to an hairs breadth, the length and bredth, and to a grain the weight and burden of the longeſt, broadeſt, and weightieſt affliction: but when he afflicts greatly, he is ſaid to afflict without meaſure, becauſe things unmeaſurable, or which cannot eaſily be meaſured, are very great. And if ever the Lord afflicted any of his (in this ſenſe) without meaſure, ſurely he afflicted <hi>Iob</hi> ſo, who thus cries out, <hi>Thou hunteſt me like a fierce Lion,</hi>

                        <hi>That when God doth greatly afflict his own people, he goes out of his ordinary way.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He ſhews himſelf marvellous or wonderfull: a man is never marvelled at, when he goes his old pace in his old path. God loves to have his hand in the hony-pot, therefore it is ſtrange to ſee him give his people a bitter cup to drink, or feeding them with wormwood and with gall. Judgement is the ſtrange work of God (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.21.) <hi>The Lord ſhall be wrath in the valley of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beon, that he may do his work, his ſtrange work, and bring to paſſe his act, his ſtrange act.</hi> And if every work of judgement be his ſtrange work, a work he delighteth not to be converſant in, what then are great and ſore judgements? Though the Lord be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely pleaſed in the executions of judgement, yet becauſe (if a <hi>more</hi> may be conceived in infinity) he is more pleaſed with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, therefore judgement is called his <hi>ſtrange work, his ſtrange act.</hi> To ſee a Prince renowned for clemency and pity, paſſing a ſevere ſentence, is a ſtrange ſight. We ſay, he hath ſhewed himſelf mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous, he hath gone againſt both his practice and his nature, his cuſtome and his inclination. To ſee any man do what he uſeth not, hath ſomewhat of wonder in it; much more, to ſee God do ſo. When he taketh up his rod we begin to ſtart, how much more
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:51057:283"/> when he taketh up his ſword, when he hunts thoſe like a lion, whom he dearly loveth, and uſes thoſe as wilde beaſts, who are his precious children; when he ſmites them with rigour, whom he carrieth in his own boſome. Theſe, theſe are acts which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him to admiration: as many acts of his power and mercy, cauſe the Saints to cry out, admiringly, yet joyfully, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee?</hi> So ſome acts of his viſible ſeverity cauſe others of them to cry out admiringly, yet ſorrowfully, Why, O God, doſt thou act, in appearance, ſo unlike thy ſelf?</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Septuagint ſaith, <hi>Thy examinations;</hi> ſo it is an alluſion to the triall of a malefactour, who is examined by the Judge, and if he deals not plainly in confeſſion, then his examination is renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                     <p>Again, As they who are of a wrangling and unquiet diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will never ſit down in a ſuit; when by the examination of ſome witneſſes, they have brought the matter to a triall, and are

                        </note>Thirdly, By Witneſſes, moſt (and they moſt clearly) underſtand his afflictions, <hi>Thou reneweſt thy witneſſes;</hi> that is, thou bringeſt new troubles to teſtifie againſt me. When one affliction hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at thy bar againſt me, thou calleſt for the teſtimony of another, and of another, and when there will not be another, I know not, unleſſe it be, when I am not. When <hi>Naomi</hi> was become <hi>Marah,</hi> (her former pleaſures being turned into bitterneſſe) ſhe ſaith (<hi>Ruth</hi> 1.21.) <hi>The Lord hath teſtified againſt me. Iob</hi> is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe in the point at the ſixteenth Chapter of this book, and the eighth verſe, which may be a Commentary upon this, <hi>Thou haſt filled me with wrinckles, which is a witneſſe againſt me: and my lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe riſing up in me, beareth witnes to my face.</hi> Afflictions bring in evidence, and teſtifie many waies.</p>
                     <p>They ſometimes witneſſe for us, evidencing our graces, our faith, patience, ſincerity and ſubmiſſion to the hand of God, they are witneſſes alſo of our adoption or ſpirituall ſonſhip (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.8.) <hi>If you be without chastiſement whereof all are partakers, then are ye baſtards, and not ſons.</hi> It is no good ſign to be free from ſufferings. <hi>Hear ye the rod,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Micah:</hi> as we ought to hear it, calling us from ſin: ſo we may hear it calling us ſons. Chaſtenings ſpeak our priviledges, as well as our duties.</p>
                     <p>They often witneſſe againſt us;</p>
                     <pb n="563" facs="tcp:51057:284"/>
                     <p>Firſt, That ſin is ſeated in us, and hath been acted by us. If we had no ſin, vve ſhould know no ſorrow. Though ſome affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are not ſent out directly againſt ſin, yet every affliction is both a conſequent and a teſtimony of remaining ſin. The bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of rods at our backs, ſaith, there is folly and ſin bound up in our hearts: and vvhen once we are purged from all ſin, vve ſhall hear no more of any affliction, of any rod. We ſhall be paſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, as ſoon as vve are paſt ſinning.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They are vvitneſſes in ſpeciall, of that great ſin, the pride of our hearts and lives. If there were not ſwellings and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumations of pride in our ſpirits, vve ſhould not feel ſuch lancings. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf acknowledges that they vvere growing upon him, if God had not taken a ſevere courſe to keep them down, <hi>Leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure, through the abundance of revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buffet me</hi> (2 Cor. 12.7.) Hence afflictions are called humiliations, both becauſe an afflicted perſon is humbled, or laid low by the hand of God, as alſo, becauſe afflictions are ſent to humble, and lay us low in our ſelves. Now, if one ſpeciall buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vvhich affliction hath vvith us, be to humble us, then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe affliction vvitneſſeth that there is pride in us. That vvhich is ſent to remove an evil, ſhews the preſence of it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They are vvitneſſes, by bringing to our remembrance the acting of forgotten ſins. Affliction is a help to memory. That vvhich vve forget we have done or ſpoken, vvitneſſes coming in, make us remember; ſo alſo do our troubles. When the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Joſeph</hi> had been put in ward three daies, and heard him demand one of them to be left, as an hoſtage in priſon, till they brought <hi>Benjamin:</hi> This diſtreſſe cauſed them to ſay, <hi>We are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily guilty concerning our brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul, when he beſought us, and we would not hear, therefore is this diſtreſſe come upon us</hi> (Gen. 42.21.) The guilt of that ſin was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty years old, but they felt not the ſmart of it, till them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſmarted for it; their impriſonment ſet their memories at liberty, and vvhen they ſaw themſelves in danger to become bond-men to the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> they had vvitneſſe enough of their ſelling <hi>Joſeph</hi> for a captive to the <hi>Iſhmaelites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Afflictions vvitneſſe obſtinacy and reſolvedneſſe in the waies of ſin, or, that afflicted perſons or Nations turn not for ſinne. Every vvound vvill open it's mouth as a vvitneſſe, and
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:51057:285"/> every ſtroak will bring an evidence againſt the impenitent. The troubles which God brought upon <hi>Ahaz</hi> witneſſed emphatically (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22.) <hi>This is that King Ahaz, who in the time of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streſſe, did trespaſſe yet more against the Lord.</hi> If we are not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by our diſtreſſes, our diſtreſſes teſtifie that we are naught, how much more when we are worſe in our diſtreſſe? As all good things which we have received, ſo all evils which we have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will riſe up in judgement againſt thoſe who ſtill continue evil.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, Afflictions witneſſe two things concerning God: Firſt, That he hath an eye upon us, and care of us. He will not let us want any thing that is needfull for us, no not affliction. Due chaſtiſement given a childe, is an argument that his father loveth him, and looks to him. Secondly, They are witneſſes of Gods fatherly diſpleaſure. Some ſay, God cannot be diſpleaſed with his children, becauſe his love is everlaſting. But will any man ſay, A father doth not love his childe, becauſe he corrects him? yet a father never correcteth his childe, but when he is diſpleaſed with him: Parents may not ſtrike unprovoked, and 'tis rare that God doth ſo. A man may be much diſpleaſed with, and much love the ſame perſon at the ſame time, and 'tis very uſuall for God to do ſo. Afflictions never teſtifie any the leaſt hatred of God againſt his people, but they often teſtifie ſome, and ſometimes great diſpleaſure, againſt his people.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Afflictions upon the godly are reckoned very ſufficient, and credible witneſſes by the world, that either they are not god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or that ſurely ſome great ungodlineſſe hath been acted by them. How many precious men have been caſt upon this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for traitors and rebels againſt God. <hi>Iobs</hi> friends took this for proof enough that he was wicked. They could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded he was good, becauſe he endured ſo many evils. As the high Prieſt cried out againſt Chriſt, what further need have we of witneſſes? behold now ye have heard his blaſphemy, ſo ſaid <hi>Iobs</hi> friends concerning him, What need have vve of further vvitneſſe? Behold vve have ſeen his miſery. What do theſe loſſes in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and ruines upon his family? What do theſe ſores upon his body, and ſorrows in his ſoul, but publiſh unto us (what he hath kept cloſe and concealed) the profaneneſſe of his ſpirit, and the hypocriſie of his former profeſſion. <hi>Iob</hi> perceiving his friends making uſe all along of this proof, as of their chiefeſt and ſtrongeſt
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:51057:285"/> 
                        <hi>medium,</hi> might well complain to God, upon the renewall of every daies affliction; <hi>Thou reneweſt thy witneſſes againſt me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>And encreaſeſt thine indignation upon me, <hi>or,</hi> Thy indignation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth upon me.</q>
                     <p>In the beginning of the verſe his own afflictions did encreaſe, but here the indignation of God. Indignation is more grievous then affliction, and the indignation of God is the moſt grievous indignation.</p>
                     <p>The word ſignifies wrath, diſpleaſure, fierce, fiery wrath, hot,<note place="margin">

                     <p>Indignation is here put for the effects of indignation; neither the wrath, nor the love of God do ever encreaſe in him, but in their exertions or in the putting of them forth towards us.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve from it,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That a godly man may conceive himſelf under the indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Church ſtoops to it (<hi>Mich.</hi> 7.9.) <hi>I will bear the indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the more we ſee of the indignation of God in any affliction, the ſorer is the affliction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the love and ſmiles of God comfort the Saints, more then all the outward comforts he heaps upon them, a little with much ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible love, is to us huge mercy. So the disfavour and frowns of God, trouble the Saints more then all the troubles, which he heaps upon them. A little with much ſenſible disfavour, is to us a heavy croſſe. Let trouble increaſe, yet if diſpleaſure abate, the ſpirit of a man will bear and ſtand under it, though his fleſh and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man fall under it. Though the furnace ſhould be heated ſeven times hotter, yet if the Lord do but let down one beam or ray of his love into the ſoul, all that burning fire will be but like a warm Sun. But when the ſcorchings of indignation mingle with affliction, this is dreadfull. <hi>The anger of a fool</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon)
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:51057:286"/> is very heavy;</hi> yet that is not ſo much as a feather to a milſtone or a mountain, compared with the anger of God. And though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are freed from that anger and indignation which he darts upon his enemies, yet they to ſenſe, yea &amp; to their preſent opinion, may be dealt with as enemies. And though the indignation which God pours upon his own people, and that upon the wicked, be as different as their ſtates are; yet the one may be under as much temporary pain and ſorrow as the other is. For as an hypocrite may for a time taſte as much of the goodneſſe of God, and feel as much joy in his ſervice, and ſometimes more, then a man who is godly and ſincere, ſo alſo may one who is godly and ſincere, taſte more of the diſpleaſure of God for a time, and feel as much ſorrow in his ſufferings, and ſometimes more, then a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Job</hi> concludes with the ſame thing, in a different habit of words. <hi>Changes and war are againſt me.</hi> I have variety of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a multitude of afflictions, and afflictions in their ſtrength, theſe three things are implied in thoſe two words,<note place="margin">Poenae militant in me. <hi>Vulg.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But rather, according to the letter of our tranſlation, <hi>Changes and warre are againſt me,</hi> that is, <hi>I am exerciſed with variety of wars.</hi> The word imports any kinde of change, change of times or change of things, it ſignifies alſo change of garments.<note place="margin">Exerceor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariu &amp; inter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe compugnanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus malis vel potius varijs &amp; ſibi invicem ſuccedentibus malorum agmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibu. <hi>Merc.</hi>
                        </note> (<hi>Judg.</hi> 14.12) That notion of the word, hath an elegancy in it in reference to <hi>Jobs</hi> condition. He was a man cloathed with affliction, ſorrow encompaſſed him as a long mourning cloak, and <hi>Iob</hi> had changes of this raiment, he went not alwaies in one ſute, though his ſutes were ſtill of one colour, for he went alwaies in <hi>blacks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, We may interpret this change, of his change from one eſtate to another, from joy to ſorrows, from peace to trouble, from plenty to want, from coſtly robes to filthy rags. Time was when <hi>Job</hi> went in ſcarlet, and fine linen, and, if he pleaſed, might have fared deliciouſly every day, but when he ſpake this,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> he was in another ſtate and habit, cloathed with ſackcloth, and lying in the duſt. It is ſaid of wicked men (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.9.) <hi>Becauſe they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.</hi> Every creature is ſubject to change, and hath ſome changes every day; God only is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. Yet ſome men ſeem to have <hi>no changes,</hi> &amp; though they cannot be free from naturall changes one moment, yet they may be free from many years civil changes: they maybe ſo far from ſuch changes as <hi>Job</hi> felt, from good to evil, that all the changes they are acquainted with, may be only from good to better, from ſtrong to ſtronger, from rich to richer: that's the intent of the <hi>Pſalm; They have no changes</hi> from joy to ſorrow, from health to ſicknes, from riches to poverty, from honour to diſgrace, <hi>therefore they fear not God;</hi> their hearts were hardned, becauſe their eſtates proſpered.</p>
                     <p>So then, theſe changes import, either divers ſorts of afflictions,
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:51057:287"/> or divers returns and charges of the ſame afflictions. The ſecond word carrieth that alluſion,<note place="margin">Agmen quidda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> malorum, ut e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam dicitur, lerna vel Ilias malorum. <hi>Mer.</hi> Vexationes tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matim me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadunt <hi>Druſ.</hi> Sagittandi &amp; militandi verba ſaepe &amp; elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in ſcripturis declarant Dei contra impios per flagella con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictum.</note> 
                        <hi>Changes and warre are upon me;</hi> that is, ſuch changes as there is in war, when firſt one regiment charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and another ſeconds, and ſo regiment after regiment, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany after company, file after file, now the right wing, and then the left, at laſt the reſerve. Thus the Lord ſeemed to bring up his bands and troops of afflictions to aſſault <hi>Job</hi> in turns and changes, till his whole army had aſſaulted and skirmiſhed with him. Thoſe military terms of ſhooting and warring, are frequent figures in Scripture, ſhewing how God conflicts with ſinfull, weak man, after the manner of men. Obſerve hence,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>That afflictions are at the command of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He marſhals and diſpoſes them, as armies are by their Generals in times of war. He can ſay to one affliction, as the Centurion to his ſouldiers, Go, and it goeth, to another, Come, and it cometh, to a third, Do this, and it doth it. All armies of ſorrow are led by God in chief. They charge whom he pleaſeth, and where he pleaſeth, high or low, perſon or nation: if he gives the word they fall on preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor will they return till he orders their retreat.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Note, <hi>That the Lord hath variety of waies and means to afflict and try his people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Changes and war are againſt me.</hi> The Phyſitian hath variety of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines for his ſick patient, if one removes not the diſtemper, he changes, and tries a ſecond. There is nothing ſo full of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as warre, not only in regard of the uncertainty of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, but variety of means, new forces being raiſed, and new ſtratagems uſed, from day to day. <hi>Haſt thou but one bleſſing?</hi> ſaid <hi>Eſau</hi> to his father <hi>Iſaac;</hi> the hand of man may be ſtraightned to one bleſſing, or one blow, but the hand of God is never ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. As he hath ſtore of bleſſings, ſo of blows, and can give both out, both in degree and kinde diverſified; if one army of evils doth not humble and conquer us to his obedience, he can quickly levy a new one. All creatures will come in to his help, if he do but ſet up his ſtandard, or give command to beat his drum. He changed his armies ten times againſt <hi>Pharaoh; Pharaoh</hi> had indeed changes and warre upon him, yet no change wrought in him: therefore the war was changed, till he was deſtroied. This war with <hi>

                  <p>THeſe five verſes are the concluſion of <hi>Jobs</hi> reply to <hi>Bildad;</hi> there are four things remarkable in them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He complaineth that ever he lived a day or an hour in the world, at the beginning of the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>Wherefore then haſt thou brought me forth out of the womb?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, He wiſheth that he had died ſpeedily: ſeeing he could not have that (ſuppoſed) happineſſe not to be born into the world, his next requeſt is, that he might not have ſtaied long in the world; he would not have appeared as a man, no nor as a childe, but that birth and buriall might have been contiguous, not knowing the diſtance of a day, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18, 19. <hi>O that I had given up the ghoſt, and no eye had ſeen me! I ſhould have been as though I had not been, I ſhould have been carried from the womb to the grave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He ſheweth, that however he had been diſappointed of both thoſe votes, yet he could not live long; As if he had ſaid, Though I have found much trouble in the world, yet I ſhall not much trouble the world, the time of my departure is at hand, I have lived moſt of my daies already, and all my daies are not many, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Are not my daies few?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He entreateth and ſueth that the few daies of thoſe few daies which he had to live, might be good daies, <hi>Are not my daies few? Ceaſe then, and let me alone, that I may take
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:51057:288"/> comfort a little, before I goe whence I ſhall not return,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſes carry a ſenſe very like to that which hath been opened at the third Chapter of this book, where <hi>Iob</hi> complained of his birth, and was troubled that he had the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a being,<note place="margin">Sui obliviſcitur ut ſupra vi do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loris. <hi>Merc.</hi>

                        <hi>Job</hi> puts the Queſtion, and demandeth an account of God, Why he came out of the womb? There are three ſorts of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Such as ariſe from a deſire of neceſſary information; 'Tis good to ask that we may learn.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Such as ariſe from a needleſſe curioſity. 'Tis not good to ask what no duty enjoyns us to learn.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Such as ariſe from pure paſſion, or rather, from mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perturbation, not ſo much deſiring information from others, as to vent our ſelves. 'Tis very ill to ask when we care not to learn. Such is the queſtion here put (ſay ſome) a paſſionate queſtion, ariſing from the fume and vapours of a diſtempered minde, deſiring to ask, rather then to be anſwered, <hi>Wherefore haſt thou brought me forth out of the womb?</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Was I born only to be an object of evil? Came I into the world to be made a ſad spectacle to the world, to Angels and to men? Have my daies been lengthened out on purpoſe, that my troubles might be lengthened?</hi> Such a troubled ſenſe there is in theſe words. The complaints of Saints may ſometimes look like the blaſphemies of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Man is apt to ſay, there is no reaſon for that, of which he ſeeth not the reaſon.</hi>

                     <p>Yet we may conceive <hi>Iob</hi> had a further ſenſe, which yeelds a more mollifying meaning of theſe words, for though he (as all the Saints in the old Teſtament) was much in the dark about the benefit of ſufferings, which the Goſpel hath now more clearly revealed to us, and called us unto; yet he might have ſome other intendment in theſe expoſtulations: We may charitably ſuppoſe him troubled that he was in a condition of life, which (as he conceived) hindered the main end of his life, the glorifying of God, <hi>Wherefore haſt thou brought me forth out of the womb?</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord, I am in a ſtate, wherein I know not how to honour thee, and then what is my life worth unto me? Thy juſtice is greatly obſcured towards me, many are ready to ſay, for my ſake, that ſurely thou art a hard Maſter, leaving them to reap evil who have ſowed good, and paying thy faithfull and moſt active ſervants their wages in ſufferings. And as for mercy, I taſte little of that;</hi>

                        </note> 
                        <hi>comforts are dainties with me: my cup is bitter, my ſorrows are multiplied: Now when neither juſtice nor mercy move viſibly towards me, how ſhall I glorifie thee? And wherein can my life be uſefull or advantagious to thee? Am I not like a broken veſſel, a veſſel wherein there is no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? Wherefore then was I brought forth out of the womb?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This expoſition teaches us, That</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A godly man thinks he liveth to no purpoſe, if he do not live to the praiſe and glory of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>God hath made all things for himſelf, and it is the deſign of the Saints to be for him. While that end is attained they can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily part with all their own; and where that is croſſed, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pleaſed in the attainment of any of their own.

They who alwaies act as farre as they may, ſhall often act beyond what they ought. And they who act at all beyond what they
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:51057:289"/> are directed, are often carried beyond what themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Obſerve, <hi>Man had rather not be ſeen at all, then to be ſeen miſerable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To be ſeen is a great part of the comfort of this life, but who would not gladly exchange it for eaſe in obſcurity? It is an honour to be ſeen, but who would be ſeen cloathed with diſhonour? When Chriſt is prophecied of, as the great patern of patience and ſelf-deniall, it is ſaid, <hi>He hid not his face from ſhame and spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> Iſa. 50.6. To be a ſpectacle of miſery, is to ſome worſe then their being miſerable. They would count it a piece of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, to be unhappy in a corner; and their troubles half remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if they might ſteal their troubles. As to be in a good eſtate, and to know that we are ſo, makes our eſtate better to us: So to be in an ill eſtate, and to be known that we are ſo, makes it to ſome tempers a great deal worſe. As the hypocrite hopes when he ſins, that no eye ſees him: ſo many wiſh when they ſuffer, <hi>O that no eye had ſeen me!</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Are not my daies few?]</hi> The queſtion doth affirm, Yes, my daies are few. The ſenſe may be made out one of theſe three waies, and not unprofitably by all three,</p>
                     <p>Firſt thus, As a juſtification of his former wiſhes and deſires to die: Have I not upon good reaſon wiſhed that I had never lived? Who can be in love with a ſhort life, and a long trouble? <hi>Are not my daies few?</hi> Or</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As an anſwer to ſuch as objected againſt him for wiſhing he had not lived: <hi>Doe you know</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>what you have ſaid? Is life ſuch a ſmall matter with you? Or doe you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what you deſire, when you deſire death? Is deformed death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a beauty in your eye? What ever you think of it, life is a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous jewel? Yes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job) I know very well what life is, and I know of I had died before I was born, I had not loſt much life; What's the life of a few daiis? The life of eternity is worth the having and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming; but why ſhould you think I have wiſhed away a matter of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when I wiſhed away this life? For are not my daies few?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whence obſerve, <hi>The loſſe of a whole life in this world, is no great loſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We cannot loſe a great deal, when all is but a little, nor many,
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:51057:291"/> when we have but a few in all. He looſeth but a few daies, who dieth the firſt day; then, what have we got, when we have lived ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the calculation of nature, many daies? <hi>Job</hi> makes this an argument to ſatisfie others about his wiſh, that all his days had bin cut off: May not we ſatisfie our ſelves by it, when a piece, or a part, an end, the worſt end of our daies is cut off? What if we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated ten or twenty of thoſe years which poſſibly we might have lived; Twenty years are but a few daies; for, a whole life, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of three twenties and ten, is but a few daies. This we are ſure of, that the few daies we looſe on earth, ſhall never be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in heaven; it will be no abatement to our comfort there, to think we lived but a little here; all the ſorrows of this life will be ſwallowed up in the next, and ſo will our ſudden parting with this life.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The cleareſt ſenſe of theſe words <hi>[Are not my daies few?]</hi> is, that they are the ground of a petition for the mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his troubles; As if he had ſaid, <hi>Lord, I have but a while to live in the world, my daies are few, therefore doe not think much that I ſhould have a little comfort and refreſhing in theſe my daies; Conſider my life is ſhort, O that thou wouldeſt ſlack thy hand, and yeeld me ſome eaſe and comfort in this ſhort life.</hi> He had uſed this argument at the ſeventh Chapter, verſe 16. <hi>Let me alone for my daies are vanity;</hi>

                     <p>From the matter of his argument, Obſerve,</p>

                        <hi>The life of man is ſhort.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a common <hi>theame,</hi> and every man thinks he can declaim upon it, and ſpeak to it; but there are very few can live to, or act by it. A multitude of inſtructions ariſe to us from the fewnes of our daies: And did men know indeed that their daies are few, their evil deeds would not be ſo many, and their good would be more.</p>
                     <p>Again, That mans daies are ſo few, yeelds us not only many inſtructions, but many wonders. Is it not ſtrange that we who have but a few daies in our lives, ſhould have ſo many afflictions in our lives? That we ſhould have few daies and many ſorrows? Is it not ſtrange that we ſhould have few daies in our lives, and

A little humane learning will ſerve to number our daies, but we need a great deal of ſpirituall learning to number them.

                        <hi>Job</hi> was in great affliction, and now a little comfort would go a great way with him.

A poor man cries out for a half-peny, for a farthing, not for hundreds or thouſands.

When once we are ſhut up in thoſe chambers of death, and made priſoners in the grave, though all the Princes in the world ſend warrants for our releaſe, we cannot get releaſed. The pertinacy and ſtiffneſſe of the grave is ſuch as yeelds to none. We are faſt ſhut up when we are ſhut up there. Love and the grave will hardly part with that, which they have cloſed with, and are poſſeſſed of.

And as it is unſatiable in receiving, ſo it is as cloſe in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will part with nothing. A grave is the Parable of a covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man; he is greedy to get, and watchfull to hold: when his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney goes into his purſe, he ſaith it ſhall not return: The grave hath a ſtrong appetite to take down, and as ſtrong a ſtomack to digeſt.

                        <hi>Every evil the more like it is to it ſelf, the worſe it is.</hi> When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle would ſhew ſin in its colours, he calleth it <hi>ſinfull ſin</hi> (Rom. 7.13.) <hi>Sin by the commandment became exceeding ſinfull,</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment cauſed it to look like it ſelf. Sorrowfull ſorrow, and painfull pain are the worſt of pains and ſorrows. There is ſorrow which may conſiſt with ſome joy and pain, which may cohabit with ſome eaſe: but he that hath ſorrow like ſorrow it ſelf, and pain like pain it ſelf, hath the extremity of both. Thus alſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, the more like it is to it ſelf, the better it is; holines like it ſelf, is the pureſt holineſſe; grace like it ſelf, is the ſweeteſt grace. When a holy man works like himſelf, his work is beſt.

Ther's no government, no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in the grave. And if it hath no order, then it hath nothing in it but confuſion, nothing but diſorder. That the grave, or the ſtate of death is without any order, may be underſtood two waies,</p>

                        </note>Firſt, Without order, becauſe it hath no changes, or viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in it, there is no difference in the grave between night and day, winter and ſummer, hot and cold, wet and dry, between the riſing and ſetting of the Sun: This is the order which God hath ſet in nature; and when the floud had put all things into a kinde of confuſion, God promiſed, <hi>That ſeed-time and harveſt, and cold and heat, ſummer and winter, day and night ſhould not ceaſe,</hi> that is, there ſhould be an everlaſting order continued in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The dead know none of thoſe changes and viciſſitudes; as much of the vanity, ſo ſome of the comforts of this life conſiſt in changes; but all is alike in death.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, There is no order in going to the grave; men do not keep to a rule in dying, nor obſerve their ranks. The old go not alwaies firſt, and then the young; the great before, and the mean following after. Death hath no maſter of the Ceremonies; but takes promiſcuouſly, here a childe, and there a man, here a rich man, and there a beggar. And as there is no order in going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo none when we are there: the grave mingleth the duſt, and bones of one with another. We cannot diſtinguiſh the rich mans duſt from the duſt of the poor, nor the bones of Kings from thoſe of the loweſt ſubject. Though rich men are buried in more eminent places, and Kings under ſtately Monuments, though their Tombs differ from their inferiours, yet their bones do not. An old Philoſopher was obſerved ſearching a caemitery, and prying buſily among the Tombs, and being asked, what he looked for, anſwered, I come to ſee if I can finde the duſt of rich men, and the bones of Princes, but I cannot ſee which is which; the duſt of the rich and of the poor, of Princes and peſants, are all alike to my eye.</p>

                        <hi>That order hath an excellency, and a beauty in it.</hi>

                     <p>The leſſe order there is in any place or ſtate, the worſe it is, and where is no order, there it is worſt of all.

His charge to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> is, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order</hi> (1 Cor. 14.40.)

                        <hi>where it lighteth like darkneſſe.</hi> The Vulgar paraphraſes rather then tranſlates, <hi>Where there is everlasting horrour. Job</hi> ſaid before, it was a land of darknes, and of darknes, like <hi>darkneſſe it ſelf:</hi> yet now he ſeemeth to affirm, that there is light in the grave, and if there be, how is that darknes like darknes it ſelf? His meaning is, that which looks moſt like to light in the grave, is darknes, and it is therefore darknes, like darknes it ſelf, becauſe if you can imagin any thing to have a ſhew of light in the grave, that very light is as darknes. When the Apoſtle would invincibly argue the infinite wiſdom and ſtrength of God, he ſaith, <hi>The fooliſhneſſe of God is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then men, and the weakneſſe of God is ſtronger then men</hi> (1 Cor. 1.25.) God is only wiſe, only ſtrong, how then ſpeaks this Apoſtle of the fooliſhneſſe or weaknes of God? His meaning is, look what act ſoever of God appears to man, as having fooliſhnes or weaknes in it, even that fooliſhnes is wiſer, and that weakneſſe ſtronger then men. In what ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The fooliſhnes of God is wiſdom, the weaknes of God is ſtrength,</hi> or (which is all one) the darknes of God is light: in the ſame <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, The light of the grave is darknes. For as God is wiſdom, and in him there is no fooliſhnes at all, ſtrength, and in him there is no weaknes at all, light, and in him there is no darknes at all: So <hi>Iob</hi> ſuppoſeth of the grave, that in it there is darknes, and no light at all, while he affirms, the light found there is as darknes. Chriſt ſpeaks near this
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:51057:296"/> language of <hi>Job (Mat.</hi> 6.23.) <hi>If therefore the light that is in thee be darknes, how great is that darknes!</hi> he had ſaid before, <hi>The light of the body is the eye, and if the eye be ſingle, the whole body is light,</hi> that is, if a man have right aims and pure ends, theſe will keep him right in all his courſe, but if his eye be dark, his ends baſe, how baſe will his actions be, how great his darknes? We may argue thus to the point in hand, if the light of the grave be darknes, how great is that darknes? The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> ſets forth great changes in States and Kingdoms by prodigious changes in the air, <hi>Lo, he makes the morning darknes,</hi> Cha. 4.15. Again, <hi>He turneth the ſhadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night,</hi> Chap. 5.8.</p>
                     <p>When either civil or morall good is turned into evil, we are paſt all hope of good; if once our light be dark, we muſt expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but darknes. The beſt works of hypocrites will be found wickednes, how wicked then will they be in their worſt? If their holines be unclean, how unclean is their unholines? All their morall light is as darknes, and all their civil light ſhall be turned into darknes.</p>
                     <p>Some (eſpecially Popiſh) Interpreters underſtand this deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption not of the grave, but of hell. The ſame word in the Hebrew ſerves both hell and the grave. Death looks like hell, and bears much of it's image. What is there in hell, but the agonies and ſweat of death, the pangs and palenes of death? the chains and bonds of death? The ſtate of the damned in hell, is an eternall act of dying. And all that <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of the grave, is fulfilled there to the utmoſt. There is darknes, like darknes it ſelf, called therefore <hi>utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;</hi> there is the ſhadow of death without any order, there the light is as darknes. But though the Text be true of hell, yet <hi>Job</hi> had nothing to do or ſuffer beyond the grave, and I ſhall carry his diſcourſe no further, keeping within thoſe confines: We may learn,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That death in it ſelf is no way deſirable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Is there any beauty in darknes, in thick darknes, where there is no order, in darknes, where the very light is darknes? One of the greateſt plagues upon <hi>Egypt,</hi>

                     <p>If death be ſuch in it ſelf, and ſuch to thoſe who die in ſin, how ſhould our hearts be raiſed up in thankfulnes to Chriſt, who hath put other terms upon death and the grave by dying for our ſins! Chriſt hath made the grave look like a heaven to his. Chriſt hath
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:51057:296"/> aboliſhed death, not death it ſelf (for even believers die) but all the trouble and terrour of death, the darknes and the diſorder of it, are taken away. Chriſt hath mortified death, kill'd death, ſo that now death is not ſo much an opening of the door of the grave, as it is an opening of the door of heaven. Chriſt, who is the Sun of righteouſnes, lay in the grave, and hath left perpetuall beams of light there for his purchaſed people. The way to the grave is very dark, but Chriſt hath ſet up lights for us, or cauſed light to ſhine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way. Chriſt hath put death into a method, yea Chriſt hath put death into a kinde of life, or he hath put life into the death of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. All the gaſtlineſſe, horrour, yea the darknes and death of death is removed. The Saints may look upon the grave as a land of light, like light it ſelf; yea as a land of life, like life it ſelf, where there is nothing but order, and where the darknes is as light.</p>
